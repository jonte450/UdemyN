And your manager calls you and says it's not running

Monitoring Overview in AWS

Why Monitoring is Important

-We know how to deploy applications
 -Safely
 -Automatically
 -Using Infrastructure as Code
 -Leveraging the best AWS components!

-Our applications are deployed, and our users don't care how we
 did it...

-Our users only care that the application is working!
 -Application latency: will it increase over time?
 -Application outages: customer experience should not be
  delegated
 -Users contacting the IT department or complaining is not
  a good outcome
 -Troubleshooting and remediation

-Internal monitoring:
 -Can we prevent issues before they happen?
 -Performance and Cost
 -Trends (scaling patterns)
 -Learning and Improvement
