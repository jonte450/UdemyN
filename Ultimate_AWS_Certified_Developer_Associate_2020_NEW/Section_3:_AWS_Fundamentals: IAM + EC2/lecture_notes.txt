AWS Fundamentals-Section Introduction
IAM how to create user and groups.
EC2.

AWS Regions and AZs
It's a global provider.
It have regions.
It have different regions with some names.


AWS Regions
-AWS has Regions all around the world.
-Names can be: us-east-l, eu-west-3...
-A region is a cluster of data centers.
-Most AWS services are region-scoped.

AWS Availability Zones

-Each region has many availbility zones
 (usually 3, min is 2, max is 6). Example:

-Each availability zone (AZ) is one or more 
 discrete data centers with redundant power,
 networking, and connectivity

-They're separate from each other, so that they are isolated
 from disasters.

-They're connected with high bandwith ultra-low latency networking

EC2 is called a regional server.
IAM is a Global Server.


 
IAM Introdution
-IAM (Identity and Access Management)
-Your whole AWS security is there:
 -Users
 -Groups
 -Roles
-Root account should never be used (and shared)
-Users must be created with proper permissions
-IAM is at the center of AWS
-Policies are written in JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)

Users
-Usually a physical person

Groups
Functions (admins , devops), Teams(engineering,design...), Conatains users!

Roles
-Internal usage within AWS resources

-IAM has a global view
-Permissions are governed by Policies (JSON)
-MFA (Multi Factor Authentication) can be setup
-IAM has predefined "managed policies"
-We'll see IAM policies in details in the future
-It's best to give users the minimal amount of permissions they need to
 perform their job (least privilege principles)

IAM Federartion
-Big enterprises usually intergrate their own repository of users with 
 IAM.
-This way, one can login into AWS using their company credentials.
-Indentity Federation uses SAML standard (Active Directory)

IAM 101 Brain Dump
-One IAM User per PHYSICAL PERSON
-One IAM Role per Application
-IAM credentials should NEVER BE SHARED
-Never, ever,ever,ever, write IAM credentials in code. EVER.
-And even less, NEVER EVER EVER COMMIT YOUR IAM credentials
-Never use the ROOT account except for initial setup
-Never use ROOT IAM Credentials


IAM Hands-On
Use the bar to find services.
Delete your root-access key.
Activate MFA.
Create users like stephane.
Give an access to your users.
We can have groups.
Create an new group.
Click on the password policy.
You have the users password in the CSV file.


EC2 Introdution
What is EC2?
-EC2 is one of most popular of AWS offering
-It mainly concists in the capability of:
 -Renting virtual machines (EC2)
 -Storing data on virtual drives (EBS)
 -Distributing load across machines (ELB)
 -Scaling the services using an auto-scaling group (ASG)

-Knowing EC2 is fundamental to understand how the Cloud works

Hands-On:
Launching an EC2 Instance running Linux
-We'll be launching our first virtual server using the AWS Console.
-We'll get a first high level approach to the various parameters.
-We'll learn how to start / stop / teriminate our instance.

Click on Launch an instance.
Select Amazon Linux
The storage is EBS.
Before Launch we have to create an key-pair.


SSH Overview
SSH works for MAC and Linux not for Windows.
Works for Windows 10.
Less than Windows 10 you can use Putty.


How to SSH using Linux or Mac
Access the EC2 machine.
We have to go ahead.
ssh ec2-user@35.180.100.144
We downloaded an key-file.
ssh -i ECTTutorial.pem ec2-user@35.180.100.144
chmod 0400 EC2Tutorial.pem
ssh -i ECTTutorial.pem ec2-user@35.180.100.144


SSH Troubleshooting

1) There's a connection timeout

This is a security group issue. Any timeout (not just for SSH) is related to security groups or a firewall. Ensure your security group looks like this and correctly assigned to your EC2 instance.


2) There's still a connection timeout issue

If your security group is properly configured as above, and you still have connection timeout issues, then that means a corporate firewall or a personal firewall is blocking the connection. Please use EC2 Instance Connect as described in the next lecture.



3) SSH does not work on Windows

If it says: ssh command not found, that means you have to use Putty

Follow again the video. If things don't work, please use EC2 Instance Connect as described in the next lecture



4) There's a connection refused

This means the instance is reachable, but no SSH utility is running on the instance

Try to restart the instance

If it doesn't work, terminate the instance and create a new one. Make sure you're using Amazon Linux 2



5)  Permission denied (publickey,gssapi-keyex,gssapi-with-mic)

This means either two things:

You are using the wrong security key or not using a security key. Please look at your EC2 instance configuration to make sure you have assigned the correct key to it.

You are using the wrong user. Make sure you have started an Amazon Linux 2 EC2 instance, and make sure you're using the user ec2-user. This is something you specify when doing ec2-user@<public-ip> (ex: ec2-user@35.180.242.162) in your SSH command or your Putty configuration



6) Nothing is working - "aaaahhhhhh"

Don't panic. Use EC2 Instance Connect from the next lecture. Make sure you started an Amazon Linux 2 and you will be able to follow along with the tutorial :)



7) I was able to connect yesterday, but today I can't

This is probably because you have stopped your EC2 instance and then started it again today. When you do so, the public IP of your EC2 instance will change. Therefore, in your command, or Putty configuration, please make sure to edit and save the new public IP.



Happy troubleshooting!
Stephane



EC2 Instance Connect
We can connect using EC2 connect.
And from the browser i can connect in the browser.
Without the terminal.


Introduction to Security Groups
-Security Groups are the fundamental of network security in AWS.
-They control how traffic is allowed into or out of our EC2 Machines.
 -www  Inbound traffic -> Security Group -> EC2 Machine
				       <- Outbound traffic 

-It is the most fundamental skill to learn to troubleshoot networking 
 issues.

-In this lecture we'll learn how to use them to allow, inbound and  
 outbound ports.



Security Groups Deep Dive
-Security groups are acting as a "firewall" on EC2 instances
-They regulate:
 -Access to Ports
 -Authorized IP ranges - IPV4 and IPV6
 -Control of inbound network(from other to the instance)

Security Groups Good to know
-Can be attached to multiple instances
-Locked down to a region /VPC combination
-Does live "outside" the EC2 - if traffic is blocked the EC2 instance 
 won't see it
-It's good to maintain one separate security group for SSH access
-If your application is not accessible (time out), then it's a security 
 group issue
-If your application gives "connection refused" error then it's an 
 application errorr or it's not launched   
-All inbound traffic is blocked by default
-All outbound traffic is authorised by default



Private vs Public vs Elastic IP
-Networking has two sorts of IP's. IPV4 and IPV6:
 -IPV4: 1.160.10.240
 -IPV6: 3ffe: 1900:4545:3:200:f8ff:fe21:67cf

-In this course, we will only be using IPV4
-IPV4 is still the most common format used online
-IPV6 is newer and solves problems for the Internet of Things(IoT)

-IPV4 allows for 3.7 billions different addresses in the public spare
-IPV4: [0-255].[0-255].[0-255].[0-255].

Fundamentals Differences
-Public IP:
 -Public IP means the machine can be indentified on the internet (WWW)
 -Must be unique across the whole web
  (not two machines can have the same IP)
 -Can be geo-located easily

-Private IP:
  -Private IP means the machine can only be indentified on a private 
   network only
  -The IP must be unique across the private network
  -BUT two different private networks (two companies) can have the same 
   IPs.
  -Machines connect to WWW using a NAT + internet gateway (a proxy)
  -Only a specified range of IPs can be used as private IP


Elastic IPs
-When you stop and then start an EC2 instance, it can change its public 
 IP.
-If you need to have a fixed public IP for your instance, you need an
 Elastic IP.
-An Elastic IP is a public IPV4 IP you own as long as you don't delete 
 it.
-You can attach it to one instance at a time.


Private vs Public vs Elastic IP Hands On
Issue commands from within.
Private ip also.
Helping us to be indentified on the private network on AWS.
Private IP doesn't change if you stop the instanses.
But the Public IP is going to change.


Install Apache on EC2
Launching an Apache Server on EC2
-Let's leverage our EC2 instance
-We'll install an Apache Web Server to display a web page.
-We'll create an index.html that shows the hostname of our machine

ssh into the instance.
sudo su
yum update -y
yum install -y httpd.x86_64
systemctl start httpd.service
systemctl enable httpd.service
curl localhost:80


EC2 User Data
-It is possible to bootstrap our instances using an EC2 User data script.
-bootstrapping means launching commands when a machine starts
-That script is only run once at the instance first start
-EC2 user data is used to automate boot tasks such as:
 -Installing updates
 -Installing software
 -Downloading common files from the internet
 -Anything you can think of
-The EC2 User Data Script runs with the root user


EC2 User Data
Hands-On
-We want to make sure that this EC2 instance has an Apache HTTP server
 installed on it - to display a simple web page
-For it, we are going to write a user-data script
-This script will be executed at the first boot of the instance

Advanced Details.
User data.
Select the first security group.

EC2 Instances Launch Types
-On Demand Instances: short workload, predictable pricing
-Reserved: (MINIUM 1 year)
 -Reserved Instances: long workloads
 -Convertible Reserved Instances: long workloads with flexible instances
 -Scheduled Reserved Instances: example - every Thursday between 3 and 6 
  pm
-Spot instances: short workloads, for cheap, can lose instances 
 (less reliable)
-Dedicated Instances: no other customers will share your hardware
-Dedicated Hosts: book an entire physical server, control instance
 placement

EC2 On Demand
-Pay for what you use (billing per second, after the first minute)
-Has the highest cost but no upfront payment
-No long term commitment

-Recommended for short-term and un-interrupted workloads, where
 you can't predicr how the application will behave.


EC2 Reserved Instances
-Up to 75% discount compared to On-demand
-Pay upfront for what you use with long term commitment
-Reservation period can be 1 or 3 years
-Reserve a specific instance type
-Recommended for steady state usage applications(think database)

-Convertible Reserved Instance
 -can change the EC2 instance type
 -Up to 54% discount

Sheduled Reserved Instances
 -launch within time window
 -When you require a fraction of day / week / month

EC2 Dedicated Hosts
-Physical dedicated EC2 server for your use
-Full control of EC2 Instance placement
-Visibility into the underlying sockets / physical cores of the hardware
-Allocated for your account for a 3 year period reservation
-More expensive

-Useful for software that have complicated licensing model 
 (BYOL-Bring Your Own License)

-Or for comapnies that have strong regulatory or compliance needs

EC2 Dedicated Instances
-Instances running on hardware that's dedicated to you
-May share hardware with other instances in same account
-No control over instance placement 
 (can move hardware after Stop / Start)


EC2 Instances Launch Types Hands On
Reserved instances are planning for
Scheduled Special Instances say how many hours per day.
Dedicated hosts gives you access to sockets.
Spot-Instances can be reclaimed by AWS.


EC2 Elastic Network Interfaces

Elastic Network Interfaces (ENI)

-Logical component in a VPC that represents a 
 virtual network card-

-The ENI can have the following attributes:
 -Primary private IPv4, one or more secondary IPV4
 -One Elastic IP (IPV4) per private IPV4
 -One Public IPV4
 -One or more security groups
 -A MAC address


-You can create ENI independently and attach them on the fly
 (move them) on EC2 instances for failove

-Bound to a specific availability zone(AZ)

eth0 and eth1 are ENI's.


EC2 Good Things to Know and Checklist

EC2 Pricing
-EC2 instances prices (per hour) varies based on these parameters:
 -Region you're in
 -Instance Type you're using
 -On-Demand vs Spot vs Reserved vs Dedicated Host
 -Linux vs Windows vs Private OS (RHEL, SLES, Windows SQL)

-You are billed by the second, with mininum of 60 seconds
-You also pay for other factors such as storage, data transfer,
 fixed IP public addresses, load balancing

-You do not pay for the Instance if it has stopped.

What's an AMI
-As we saw, AWS comes with base images such as:
 -Ubuntu
 -Fedor
 -RedHat
 -Windows
 -Etc...
-These images can be customised at runtime using EC2 User data

-But what if we could create our own image, ready to go?
-That's an AMI - an image to use to create our instances
-AMIs can be built for Linux or Windows machines

What would you use a custom AMI?
-Using a custom built AMI can provide the following advantages:
 -Pre-installed packages needed
 -Faster boot time (no need for long ec2 user data at boot time)
 -Machine comes configured with monitoring / enterprise software
 -Security concern - control over the machines in the network
 -Control of maintenance and updates of AMIs over time
 -Active Directory Integration out of the box
 -Installing your app ahead of time 
  (for faster deploys when auto-scaling)
 -Using someone else's AMI that is optimised for running an app,DB,
  etc...
-AMI are built for a specific AWS region(!)

EC2 Instances Overview
-Instances have 5 distinct characteristics advertised on the website:
 -The RAM(type,amount)
 -The CPU (type,make,frequency,generation, number of cores)
 -The I/O (disk performances, EBS optimizations)
 -The Network(network bandwith, network latency)
 -The Graphical Processing Unit (GPU)

-It may be daunting to choose the right instance type
 (there are over 50 of them)-
 https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/

-https://ec2instances.info/ can help with summarizing the types of 
 instances


Burstable Instances (T2)
-AWS has the concept of burstable instances (T2 machines)
-Burst means that overall, the instance has OK CPU performance
-When the machine needs to process something unexpected 
 (a spike in load for example), it can burst, and CPU can be very good
-If the machine bursts, it utilizes "burst credits"
-If all the credits are gone, the CPU becomes BAD

EC2-Checklist
-Know how to SSH into EC2 (and change .pem file permissons)
-Know how to properly use security groups
-Know the fundamental differences between private vs public vs elastic IP
-Know how to use User Data to customize your instance at boot time
-Know that you can build custom AMI to enhance your OS

-EC2 instances are billed by the second and can be easily created and 
 thrown away, welcome to the cloud



Quiz 2: EC2 Final Quiz

Question 1:
You plan on running an open-source MongoDB database year-round on EC2. Which instance launch mode should you choose?

Answer:
   Reserved Instances 

   This will allow you to save cost as you know in advance that the instance will be a up for a full year

Question 2:
You are launching an EC2 instance in us-east-1 using this Python script snippet:

(we will see SDK in a later section, for now just look at the code reference ImageId)

ec2.create_instances(ImageId='ami-b23a5e7', MinCount=1, MaxCount=1)
It works well, so you decide to deploy your script in us-west-1 as well. There, the script does not work and fails with "ami not found" error. What's the problem?

Answer:
  AMI is region locked and the same ID cannot be used across regions


Question 3:
You would like to deploy a database technology and the vendor license bills you based on the physical cores and underlying network socket visibility. Which EC2 launch modes allow you to get visibility into them?

Answer:
   Dedicated Hosts

Question 4:

You are running a critical workload of three hours per week, on Monday. As a solutions architect, which EC2 Instance Launch Type should you choose to maximize the cost savings while ensuring the application stability?  

Answer:
   Scheduled Reserved Instances
