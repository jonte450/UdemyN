Cognito Overview
Amazon Cognito
-We want to give our users an indentity so that they can
 interact with our application

-Cognito User Pools:
 -Sign in functionality for app users
 -Integrate with API Gateway & Application Load Balancer

-Cognito Indentity Pools (Federated Identity):
 -Provide AWS credentials to users so they can access AWS 
  resources directly

 -Integrate with Cognito User Pools as an identity provider

-Cognito Sync:
 -Synchronize data from device to Cognito
 -Is deprecated and replaced by AppSync

-Cognito vs IAM: "hundreds of users" , "mobile users" , 
                 "authenticate with SAML"



Cognito User Pools

Cognito User Pools (CUP) - User Features
-Create a serverless database of user for your web & mobile apps
-Simple login: Username (or email) / password combination
-Password reset
-Email & Phone Number Verification
-Multi-factor authentication(MFA)
-Federated Identities: users from Facebook, Google, SAML...
-Feature: block users if their credentials are compromised 
 elsewhere
-Login sends back a JSON Web Token(JWT)


Cognito User Pools (CUP) - Diagram
CUP will have a database of users.
Returns a JWT.
Integrate with Social Identity Provider for example:
Google, Facebook, SAML.

IdP connect.


Cognito User Pools (CUP) - Integrations
-CUP integrates with API Gateway and Application Load Balancer
Authenticate Retrieve 
REST API + Pass Token
Cognito User Pools
Authenticate.



Cognito User Pools Hands On
Cognito has two user pools.
Indentity pools.
Step through the settings.
Let's verify with Email.
Enable MFA.
Which attributes to verify.
Customizes workflow.
Lots of options.
Create an APP client.
Go to App client settings.
Do a hosted UI.
Choose a domain name.
Launch the hosted UI.
Based on the use case we can choose a Lambda Function.



Cognito User Pools - Others

Cognito User Pools - Lambda Triggers
-CUP can invoke a Lambda function synchronously


Cognito Users Pools - Hosted Authentication
-Cognito has a hosted authentication
 UI that you can add to your app to
 handle sign-up and sign-in workflows

-Using the hosted UI, you have a foundation
 for integration with social logins, OIDC
 or SAML

-Can customize with a custom logo
 and custom CSS





Cognito Identity Pools

Cognito Identity Pools (Federated Indentities)
-Get identities for "users" so they can obtain temporary
 AWS credentials

-Your identity pool (e.g identity source) can include:
 -Public Providers (Login with Amazon,Facebook,Google,Apple)
 -Users in an Amazon Cognito user pool
 -OpenID Connect Providers & SAML Identity Providers
 -Developer Authenticated Identities (custom login server)
 -Cognito Identity Pools allow for unauthenticaticated(guess) 
  access

-Users can then access AWS services directly or through API
 Gateway

 -The IAM policies applied to the credentials are defined in 
  Cognito

 -They can be customized based on the user_id for fine grained 
  control


Cognito Identity Pools - Diagram
We are going to leverage te user pools.
We want to connect to Social Identity Provider.
Cognito will talk to STS.
And then can access.


Cognito Identity Pools - Diagram with CUP
We want all the users to be centralized.
And then it can exchange to access.


Cognito Identity Pools - IAM Roles
-Default IAM roles for authenticated and guest users
-Define rules to choose the role for each user based on the
 user's ID

-You can partition your user's access using policy variables

-IAM credentials are obtained by Cognito Identity Pools through 
 STS

-The roles must have a "trust" policy of Cognito Identity Pools




Cognito Identity Pools
To quickly switch.
We need to Create an identity pools.
We have the authenticated flow settings.
Go to app clients.
Identify the IAM rules.
Role for the normal users.
Federated Identity.
We have to roles.
Edit Identity pools.




Cognito Identity Pools Hands On



Cognito User Pools vs Cognito Identity Pools
-Cognito User Pools vs Identity Pools
 -Database of users for your web and mobile application
 -Allows to federate logins through Public Social,OIDC, SAML...
 -Can customize the hosted UI for authentication 
  (including the logo)]
 -Has triggers with AWS Lambda during the authentication flow

-Cognito Identity Pools:
 -Obtain AWS credentials for your users
 -Users can login through Public Social, OICD, 
  SAML & Cognito User Pools
 
 -Users can beb unauthenticaticated (guests)

 -Users are mapped to IAM roles & policies, can leverage policy
  variables

-CUP + CIP = manage user / password + access AWS services



Cognito Sync
-Deprecated - use AWS AppSync now
-Store preferences, configuration, state of app
-Cross device synchronization
 (any platform- iOS, Android, etc...)

-Offline capability (synchronization when back online)
-Store data in datasets(up to 1 MB) up to 20 databases 
 synchronize

-Push Sync: silently notify across all devices when identity 
			changes

-Cognito Stream: stream data from Cognito into Kinesis

-Cognito Events: execute Lambda functions in response to events
