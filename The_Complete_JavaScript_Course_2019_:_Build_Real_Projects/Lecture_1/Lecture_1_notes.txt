A Brief Introduction to JavaScript

Lightweight, Cross-platforms, Objecti-oriented
Programming Language.
JavasScript one of the Core technologies.
Lots of JavaScript frameworks.
React,Angular,Jquery.

Variables and Data Types

Variable are like an container.
var keyword.
Datatypes 
Numbers: that are floating type.
String: Sequence of characters.
Boolean: Logical values like binary true or false.
Undefined: Datatype that dosen't have any value yet.
Null: Also like undefined that are non-existent.
JavaScript is a Dynamic Typing language.
You don't have to specify data types.

Variable Mutation and Type Coercion

Comments 
Single line //.
Multiples lines /**/.
JavaScript automatically convert data types.
alert is command to an pop-up window.
prompt is command to get an value you can store in an variable from the input.

Basic Operators.

Math operators: +,-,/,*
typepof: A operator that shows the type of an variable.

Operator predence

Different operators does executes differently before each other.
List of different operators you can find on mozarilla developer on google search.

If / else Statements

Only execute some parts of the code.
Logical operator ===.
if and else have some codeblocks that execute some codes.
True values dosen't need any comparison if it are only boolean value.

Boolean Logic.

else if to have after an if-statement to test an range.
Three boolean logic operators:
And (&&) => if All are true.
OR (||) => true if One is true.
NOT (!) => inverts true/false value.
Logical operators also has an precedence.

The Ternary Operator and Switch Statements.

Ternary Operateror is that you write an if/else statement on one line: age >= 18 ? console.log(firstName + ' drinks beer.') : console.log(firstName + ' drinks juice.').
You can assign variables with the hep with ternary operator.
Switch statement is that you have mutiples if/else statements.
Cases in switch must have break statements because it will continue to evalute the next case statements.
switch(true) to work with ranges.
default: standard like else-statements.

Truthy and Falsy values and equality operators

Falsy values things that are considered false.
Falsy values: undefined, null, 0, '', NaN.
Truthy values things that are considered true.
Truthy values: Values that are not falsy.
== the types dosen't has to match this operator uses types conversion.
=== strict operator avoids type-conversion.



Objects and Properties

List of variables separties with an comma.
Another object within an object.
Call var john.properties
Brackets to retrieve an Properties
Mutate object => john. Job = ‘designer’
Create a new object
Var jane = new Object();

Objects and methods

Function keyword.
Function body.
Calling like an variable.
This keyword means current object.


Loops and iterations

Repetitive tasks.
For-loop three parts.
Loop-block.
John.length an dynamic way of loop through an array.
While-loops.
Continue quit with the current itertion and begin the next iteration.
Break exit the current iteration and the loop .
