Build out the form for us.

We are going to use the dropdown.

Stripe Intergration
You need some activation.
Due to legal reasons so that they can confirm your payments.
Intergrate the stripe to your page.
Play around with stripe.

Go to developers-section.
We want the API-keys.
Tell the stripe we want use the account.
You can only make charges with an backend server.
We want the publisher key.

yarn add react-stripe-checkout.
What it gives us the React.
We are going to create an new component.

We make an new file called stripe-button.component.jsx

import React from 'react';
import StripeCheckout from 'react-stripe-checkout';

const StripeCheckoutButton = ({ price }) => {
	const priceForStripe = price * 100;
	const publishableKey = 'Publishable Key';

	const onToken = token => {
	console.log(token);
	alert('Payment Successful')
	}


	return (
	<StripeCheckout
	label='Pay Now'
	name='CRWN Clothing Ltd.'
	billingAddress
	shippingAddress
	image='https://svgshare.com/i/CUz.svg'
	description={'Your total is $${price}'}
	amount={priceForStripe}
	panelLabel='Pay Now'
	token={}
	/>
	);
};

export default StripeCheckoutButton;

Import into the checkout button.
And place last.

Note about Test credit cards for Stripes
As of January 2020, our test credit card date is now past 01/20 so you'll see an error using this date. Just change the test date to any date in the future from your current date! You can find more details about this at the link here for documentation on stripe's testing cards.

Cloning From This Point On

From this point on, if you fork and clone any GitHub links for this course, you must remember to set the publishableKey  in stripe-button.component.jsx to your own publishable_key value in your stripe dashboard. This key allows stripe to know that requests from any stripe checkout components are connected to your stripe account! You can find the key under the Developers Tab, and then the API keys tab in the menu that opens!
