secure layer.

JSON
Can we post anything.
The data can only be text.
The server can use any type of language.
Text can be understand by all other.

Standard is more to JSON.
JSON can be read by any languages.
-JSON.parse()

AJAX
Sometimes all things has to be reloaded.

I can click on tabs and it loads data automatically on the page.
Read from the webpage after was loaded.
Allowed to load the page and send data in background.
How are we able to do it.
XML HTTP request.
fetch().

Load an base and build  rest.
fetch returns an json object.

Promises
A new feature to ES6.
Promise
-A promise is an object that may produce a single value some time in the future.
-Either a resolved value, or a reason that it's not resolved(rejected).

Three states 
-fullfilled
-rejected
-pending

What did we have before promises.
Callbacks.
Example move players with callbacks fuctions pyramid of doom.
An app like twitter.
Grab an tweets.
We have to check for errors.
Promises that resolves or rejects.
What can we do with promises.
Changing with promises.
Catch errors.
Catch only read between lines.
A promise has an resolve and reject.
We can give it to an variable.
Do something chained and catch errors.
Promise.all().
Promises can only fail once.
Good for AJAX calls.

ES8-Async Await
Is built on top of the promises.
Makes codes easier to read.
Makes codes that are not synchornous look like it.
Async Await call for synctactic sugar.
You can wait and assign it to variables.
Do something more different.
