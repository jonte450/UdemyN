Introduction To Databases
All Companies stores data.
Need something to store informations.
Iterating over things is not so efficeny.
There could be different things.
Organize the data.
DBMS Data Management System.
DBMS is a kind of a box allows us to communicate.
1960.
Two types of DBMS
-Postgre
-MongoDBMS

Relational-database.
Two or more tables.
Schema must be cleared defined.
Connecting different tables.
Username is a foreign key.
That identifies each row is called primary key.
How do they communicates with the server.
SQL allows us to communicate with the database.

Non-Relational Databases.
Allowing us to build an database without an schema.
Define it as we go.
Aren't clear.
Are more like folders.
MongoDB is called documented.

RELATIONAL VS NON-RELATIONAL DATABASES
Relational-Database
-Blog Post
-Blog Tags
-Blog Comments
Organizes structured data fields into defined columns

Non-Relational Database
-Comments
-Tags
-Catergories
-All other related data
Data can be stored in a single documented file

Installing PostgreSQL
MongoDB has been popular.
MongoDB is very simple.
Think it is an JSON-file.
Brew will install postgrsql also.
Asks for the host.

SQL:Create Table
Create Table to enter an table.
Every coloumn has an datatype.
Their site has different datatypes.
Datatypes
-Text
-Smallint
-Date

SQL:Insert Into + Select   
Insert into and values with names and everything.
How can we grab information.
We use Select name,age,birthday FROM users;
Select *FROM.

SQL:After Table + Update
How can we add an new table to the table.
Update table_name.
Where some column equal some name.
Update set scores where name="some name".

SQL:Conditional Selections
Select * From  where name like 'A%'.
Getting everything sorted in order.
Select * FROM users ORDER BY score DEC;

SQL:Functions
Can also have functions.
Select AVG(score) From users.
Select SUM(age) From users.
Select COUNT(name) From users.

SQL:Joining Tables Part 1
CREATE TABLE datatype serial.
Serial is an unique key to create for the users.
Primary keys are only one per table.
Fast way to grabbing information.
Unique to make every word if it exist don't insert.
Not null must have some characters.
Foreign key is referencing a column.

SQL:Joining Tables Part 2
Having tables connecting them through Primary Key and a Foreign Key.
Join a powerful keyword in SQL.
Concerned with minimal information.
When you create a primary key SQL creates another file.
By using JOINS login.name = users.name.

SQL:Delete From + Drop Table
Key tablename Where name = 'some_name';
Delete Table => DROP TABLE tablename.
