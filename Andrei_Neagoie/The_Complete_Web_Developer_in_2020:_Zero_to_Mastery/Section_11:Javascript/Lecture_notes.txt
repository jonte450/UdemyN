Introduction To Javascript
Feeling confused first time when i first learned javascript.
Don't have to know every keyword.
It going to feeling very attached.

What is Javascript
Think javascript as an verb you are doing on the website.
On the time 1995 Netscape was the most popular browser. Every browser had 
their own version.
ECMAscript.
The same issue.
Make sure that every browser understand your javascript.
Open up the browser.
Instagram uses javascrip and virtually relity, program drones, robotics.
Node.js learn this topics is pretty much javascript and so Express js and React.
Its just a file.

Your First Javsscript
Console is where you can write Javascript.
Has 7 types think types as values Javascript can have.
-Numbers do operations 
-Strings just a piece of text ""
-Boolean very simple means just true or false

// Guess what answers you would get if you ran this in the
// Javascript Console in Google Chrome. Once you have an answer  to the questions then 
// check them by copying them and running it in the console yourself line by line 


//Evaluate the below:
5 + "34" => "345" => Right
5 - "4" => 1 => Right
10 % 5 => 0 => Right
5 % 10 => 5 => Right
"Java" + "Script" => "JavaScript" => Right
" " + " " => "  " => Right
" " + 0 => "0" => Wrong => " 0"
true + true => true => Wrong => 2
true + false => 1 => Right
false + true => 1 => Right
false - true => -1 => Right
3 - 4 => -1 => Right
"Bob" - "bill" => Error => Wrong => NaN


//Evaluate the below comparisons:
5 >= 1 => True => Right
0 === 1 => False => Right
4 <= 1 => False =>  Right
1 != 1 => False => Right
"A" > "B" => True => Wrong Its False
"B" < "C" => True => Right
"a" > "A" => True => Right
"b" < "A" => False => Right
true === false => False => Right
true != true => False =>  Right


// Make the string: "Hi There! It ts "sunny" out" by using the + sign:
"Hi There " + "It\'s \"sunny\" out"

Variables
How does Javascript remebers things.
Do something hundred of times.
Has variables to remeber things.
Store things in variables.
Rules with a variable must start with a letter , $ , _.
Camelcase firstName.
Prompt get inputs.
Number() to convert some text to an number.
alert() pop-up window.

// Evaluate what answers you would get if you ran this in the
// Javascript Console in Google Chrome. Answer the questions then 
// check them by copying them and running it in the console yourself 
// line by line 


// add variable "firstName" and "lastName" // so that they equal your name
// add variable "firstName" and "lastName" // so that they equal your name
var firstName = "Jonte";
var lastName = "Y";

// create a variable that holds the answer // of "firstName" + " " + "LastName"
var fullName = firstName + " " + lastName;

// create a variable that holds the answer // of "firstName" + " " + "lastName"

// Evaluate this question. What is a + b?
var a = 34;
var b = 21;
a = 2;
a + b // what is the answer here?
23 Right

// What is c equal to?
var c;
undefined.

Why to use semicolon means end of an expression.

The official guidelines say that JS uses a semi colon to terminate a statement. The ECMAScript spec describes how, if a statement is not explicitly terminated with a semicolon, sometimes a semicolon will be automatically inserted by JavaScript engine (called “Automatic Semicolon Insertion” (ASI)).

Control Flow
Flows like a water.
If we want to go one way or another way.
Handles other cases.
We want an alternative route.
Else.
Else if multiple conditions.
Or || , And &&, ! Not Equal.

Javascript On Our Page
How does javascript gets implemented in the browser.
There exist an script-tag.
It has an attribute called type="text/javascript"
You can have multiply script tags.
If put the script-tags gonna make the html being delayed.

Functions
What are functions.
Pieces of codes that perform an action or multiple actions.
Types of functions in Javascript prompt(),alert().
Calling an function for example alert().
Arguments in functions alert("hi there").
The greatest advantages of using functions it's that you can call it multiple times.
Creating an function with keyword function.
You can have an function creating is called anomynous function.
DRY do not repeat yourself.
Used an argument to the function sing().
When the function in javascript dosen't return anything it returns as default undefined.
To return a value you must use keyword return-keyword.
arguments its called when you are calling an function.
parameters its called the variables the function is using.
Functions are the core of javascript.

Data Structures: Arrays
What is an data-structure.
Data-structures are like comportant holders.
Gives the ability to store things.
Create with [].
Starting from 0.
You can have numbers,booleans,functions.
You can even mix numbers,booleans,functions.

Data Structures: Objects
Curly brackets {}.
Key and values.
Looks a bit different from an array.
Object is more dynamic.
Arrays has an index.
How do i grab properties.
You can easily add properties to an object.
Array is just like an index with elements.
You want to have all things organized.
But an object is better to containing user information.
You can a list of objects.
You can add functions to an object.
Function inside an object is called an method.
Console is also an object.
Something called Null.
Special type Null.
Means nothing in the object.

Exercise: Build Facebook
We have an sign-up form.
Have an variable with is an array called database.
Prompt accepts username and password.
Facebook is made of full small chunks.

Javascript Terminology
Function 
And expression is something that produces an value.
Calling or invoking an function.
Method is a function inside a object and is accessed with a dot.

Loops
Doing over and over.
Todo-list.
Todo-list was hundred of lines.
for-loop.
Length tells how many items in the list.
Tells the loop to stop with 5 < todos.length.
Save the list length variable in separate variable.
While-loop evalutating separate declared variables.
Infinite-loop will make the programmet crash.
do-while-loop do the stuff first and after that check the condition.
Most of the time use for-loop.
For-each loop takes in a list an function with an argument and asks what to do with the arguments.
Second argument in the for-each loop is the index.
For-each is really powerful.

Exercise: Build Facebook 2
Adding more users.
We add a an loop to check the users.
If the userName and Password is equal show the newsfeed.
Create an new function for that is called isUserValid().
This returns true or false.

Javascript Keywords
It has its own language called keywords.
Predefined name meaning attached to it.
You cannot use keywords.
