Introduction To React.js
We had jqeury before react.
What to change and becomes more complex.
Is like an bread-machine makes magic under the hood.
Easy to scale and manage.
Thinking in components.
Was as small components like lego-blocks and build it ensembled.
One way data flow.
Data flows from top to bottom.
Virtual DOM we have to reduce DOM-manipulations.
We were like painters.
Virtual DOM is like an javascript-object.
React takes care of DOM-Manipulations.
We can change the canvas to whatever we want.
Has an great Ecosystem.

It can be used in multiple places for websites.
import./index.css add css files for every components.
registerServiceWorkers new feature to make the app works faster and work offline.
We are creating our own custom html-tags.
Rule we all ways to have an render function.
We have to export it too.
Multiple lines you must wrap it in brackets.
tachyons to help with css things.
You must have className instead of class.
JSX React has the idea of components it's better to have functionality so
that components are only concerned about themselves.
Everytime i make an change.
React uses their fake dome and compares the DOM hmm i need to make 
changes to the DOM.
You can add props think them as attributes.
