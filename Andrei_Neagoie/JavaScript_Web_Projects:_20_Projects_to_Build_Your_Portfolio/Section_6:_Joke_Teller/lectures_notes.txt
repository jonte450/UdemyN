RapidAPI Disclaimer

It has been brought to my attention that for some students the RapidAPI website doesn't work exactly as it does in the video. I apologize for any confusion or inconvenience.

You don't need to follow along with the tasks on the RapidAPI website, it was intended as a guide to show how you'd choose an API you'd never used before and test it.

Please continue on and work on the project code,
the APIs will work in the code.

Hope you've been enjoying the course so far! 


Javascript In The Project
We made contact to the Voice API.
And got the API key.
And after that we could hear the voice
Hello World.


Javascript In The Project 2
Getting the API call from the Joke API.
Making so that setup and delivery became
one single string separating by ...


Javascript In The Project 3
Creatring a tellMe function.
And input the joke string to the 
audio api call.



Finishing Up The Project
Adding a toogle button that disables
the button when it plays.
And hides the audio.


Code Review
We could move the SDK code to another
file and we must think about the API
key in the Front-End.
