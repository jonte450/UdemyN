Bruno's Request
Can you set up the SSH on your github account.

Introduction to SSH
Course was mean to connect the dots.
Software that compete.
SSH is a protocol to speak with each other.
Protocols.

-HTTP
Helps sending HTML,CSS,JAVASCRIPTS files.

-FTP
Allows you to send files like hostgator.

-HTTPS
Similar to HTTP but it is encrypted.

-SSH
Allows us to communicate with the internet.
Share files and controls.
An secure way to communicate.
An protocol allowed for the shell.
Between the host and client.

SSH Command
ssh {user} @ {host}.
Digital ocean is an provider that is really cheap.
Created droplets.
How to set everything up.
PUTTY.
With SSH you can connect with any computer.
Story time
First day Andrei was asked to connect github with ssh.
No idea how to do.
You will use SSH all time in your career
Remotely access another computer.

IP
192.168.1.168 
192.168.122.1 
172.17.0.1 
fd71:60e3:c70c:0:5d0:6506:80e0:5923 fd71:60e3:c70c:0:9d07:72b0:b978:1cd1  

Saving The Day Through SSH
We need to install git.
Go to the zero-to-mastery.
Git clone repo.
Run nodejs install.
Use rsync.

How SSH Works
About the encryption techniq.
Three Techniques in SSH.
-Symmetrical Encryption
-Asymmetrical Encryption
-Hashing

Symmetric Encryption
To hide some text. 
To make it have some secrets.
Can have an key to turn something to jibberish.
The host has the same key.
One problem you notice here.
If mr Bad guy notices the key he can decrypt the message.
Key-ExChange algorithm.
Make some key-exchange.

Asymmetric Ecryption
Uses two separate keys for encryption and decryption.
The two forms key-pair.
These two keys are linked.
One-way relationship.
Diffie Hellman Key Exchange.
Share their respective keys with each other.

Hashing
Most uses symetric encryption to send.
Someone can be in the middle and temper with the message.
To solve this you use hashning.
One way the hash-function it encrypt that spits out jibberish.
HMX must contain an mac-address.

Passwords Or SSH?
1.Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange
2.Arrive at Symmertric Key
3.Make sure of no funny busniess
4.Authenticate User
The server must check the sender.
We wanna make sure he or she be able to communicate.
Make sure.
Two-ways to authenticate to the server.
Digital-ocean email me.
It is not recommended to use passwords to communicate.

SSH Into A Server
Use RSA.
Go into an Folder that should be up.
ssh-keygen -C to generate an key.
This public key you can share with someone else.
pbcopy to share the key.
mkdir .ssh ls directory.
Copy the public key.
Add your key.

Exercise: Set Up SSH on Github
Setup the SSH to your Github.
You go into settings and add your ssh keys.

Section Summary
Share a secret to make it able to talk with each other.
No funny bussniess.
Two things.
With password or SSH-keys allows to proves that you can communicate
securitely.
