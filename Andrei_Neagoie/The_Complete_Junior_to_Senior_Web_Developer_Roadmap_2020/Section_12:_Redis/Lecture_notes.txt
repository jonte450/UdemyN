Bruno's Request
Getting complaints with that users can seen other users sessions.
Getting into a topic a secure way to handle sessions.
Especially problem for users to see others users.

Section Overview
With Databases it is tons of them.
You have to define your schemas.
Postgresql is to define relationship.
All companies used a tons of different databases.
Redis is NoSQL in memory database.
Used to build high scalabale perfomance applications.
Have different types.
Your profile has different of databases.
Document 
Are good to store document data.

-mongoDB
-CouchDB

Graph
For social media.
-neo4j

Wide Column
-cassandra

Key-value
Similar to how we handle objects.

-redis 
In memory data-base.
You wanna use a small piece of data.
Used for short-memory.
Super flexible.

Introduction To Databases
All companies store data.
In order to store information
We want to do a loop.
Is just a collection of data.
DBMS is tool that allows us to communicate with Databases.
Consist of more than one table.
Schema,us be defined.
We can connect tables.
Indentifies one row is called primary Key. 

Installing Redis
Let's install Redis.
It is very simple to download Redis.
Might use it later.

Redis Commands
Super fast to access.
It only takes an snap-shot.
Using in only in session-management.
We are gonna talk about the data-types.
Is a key-value storage.
Set name "Godzilla"
Now i can get command to get the value back.
Get name results in "Godzilla" back.
EXISTS name return 1.
DEL name removes the name.
Documentation tab.
Full lists of command.
Expire command.
Sets an Key to expire to some seconds or minuts.
SET counter 1000; 
INCRBY counter 33.
DECR counter 33.
Increament and decreament of the counter variable.

Redis Data Types
MSET to set multituple things.
GET a.
MGET a b.
You noticed some things we only worked on strings.

Five major datatypes.

-strings
-hashes
-Lists
-Sets
-Sorted Sets

Redis Hashes
Are maps between strings fields and strings values.
Think on them as objects.
HMSET user id 45 name "Jonny" [].
HGet user name 
Gives back Jonny.
HGETALL users gives back all the user info.

Redis Lists
The next Datatype is implemented as LinkedLists.
Insertions is really fast.
It takes a bit a time.
Add elements to the lists.
LPUSH ourlists 10
RPUSH ourlists  "Hello".
LRANGE key start stop 0 1
1) "10"
2) "Hello"

LTRIM to trim the lists.

Redis Sets + Sorted Lists
Sets are in Redis are unordered collections of strings.
With sets it is able to remove strings.
Adding more elements is not gonna effect the sets.
SADD ourset 1 2 3 4 5.
SMEMEBERS ourset 
Gives the elements of the set.
SISMEMBER ourset 5 gives 1 or 0 if the 5 is memeber of the sets.
Sorted Sets do the no-repeating of the string.
And we have an score that ranges from the smallest to the greatest.
ZADD team 50 "Wizards"
ZADD team 40 "Cavaliers"
ZRANGE team 0 1.

Section Summary
In this section we learned Redis.
We are gonna add this to our Docker-Container.
This is a special section.
Add to our Docker-container.
A lot of fun.
