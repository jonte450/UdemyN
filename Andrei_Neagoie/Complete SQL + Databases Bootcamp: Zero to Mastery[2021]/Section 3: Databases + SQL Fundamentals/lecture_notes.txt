SQL Playground
Tools to test queries.
db-fiddle.
Helps us quickly to create a database.
Switch between different versions in SQL.
Learning small concepts.



What is SQL
Programming language to talk to a system.
Mainly talking to databases.
You determine what to use.
We are looking on big companies.
You need a larger system to store data.
Talk about different models.


What Is A Query
A query is nothing more than a question.
Get a answer from the database.

SELECT * FROM USERS

Query Breakdown

SELECT NAME
FROM USERS
WHERE ROLE = "MANAGER";



Exercise Setting Up Your First Database
Get the Students id and name here

Select id, firstName, lastName 
From Student;

Get every student info.

Select *
FROM Student;


Imperative vs Declarative
What Will Happen
Declarative

make a sandwich with ham

How it Will Happen.
Imperative

-slice bread
-slice hame
-make sandwich


History of SQL
SQL?
SEQUEL?

Structure Query Language.
Invented in the early 80.
Edgar Chod sat the standard.
Two other developers implemented his idea:
Donald Chamberlain and Raymond Boyce.

Exercise: The Select Statement
Select *FÅ”OM Customers;
Select City FROM Customers;


SQL Standards
There are some rules that everybody must follow.
To put togheter some rules.
SQL is a widely adopted language.
You have concistency.



What Is A Database? Revistied
What is actually a database.
A data that is structure a special way.

FILE PROCESSING SYSTEMS
Was a massive leap ahead.
Saving data on individual files.
There was non relationship between the files.
Copying in customer information.
The user need to learn every particular system.


Database Oriented Approach
Migrate to a database approach.
Database management.
The only task is to manage your data.
Every concept will become managed.
Enforcing a structure.
Following the same principle.
DMBS helped you to manage the data with SQL.



Exercise; SQL Starter Quiz
What is the SELECT statement used for?
To SELECT data from a table



Which of the following SELECT statements are correct?
SELECT * FROM student;


Which of the following SELECT statement are incorrect? (multiple)



What is SQL?
Declarative

What does SQL stand for?
Structured Query Language



Database Models
-Hierchical
-Networking
-Entity-Relationship
-Relational
-Object Oriented
-Flat
-Semi-Structured


Hierchical And Networking Model

Hierchical Model
Haven't seen today anymore.
It deceide to store the data in a tree-structure.
Every child can only have a single root.
When you delete a parent every other get's deleted.
Tight-coupled.
One-To many relationships.

Network Model.
Allowed many-to-many relationships.
Become a bit complicated.


Relational Model
There wasn't any rules set for the Hierchical and Networking model.
Relational Model.
Table structure.
What is a table?
You can give a sheet a name.
We specify some id to indentify the data.
Same for books.
Id's must be unique.


DBMS Revisited
A piece of software that is supervisor of the data.
Kinda of a refree.
You take a excel-sheet and make it more smarter.
C-Create
R-Read
U-Update
D-Delete
Always staying safe and accessable and atomic transactions.
Some companies makes a database that is better in someway.
13 Rules Of Codd
Rules that's have to be followed when you are building a DBMS.



Relational Model Revisited
-Relation Schema
-Attribute
-Degree
-Cardinality
-Tuple
-Column
-Relation Key
-Domain
-Tables
-Relation Instance



Tables
Is a representation of a object.
Column specify some type of a data.
Rows is a single piece of data.



Columns
Degree is the sum of all columns.
The degree is a collection of columns.
Domain is a constraint saying in one column you only put one sorts of data-type.
Columns have these attributes.


Rows
Tuples is another way to name rows.
Cardinality is the collection of rows.



Primary And Foreign Keys
Link relationships between the data.
Primary key is that uniquely indentifies the data.

Foreign Key is to reference to a different table.


OLTP vs OLAP
Support Day to Day
OLTP store and catergorize the data.


Support Analysis
OLAP
Takes the data and puts that in a data warehouse.

Exercise OLAP vs OLTP
1.A Database is being used to log orders and customers
  OLTP

2.A Database is being used to figure out what new products we should
  offer
  OLAP


3.A Database is being used to derive statics for reporting
  to the executives
  OLAP

4.A Database is being used to keep track of logged in users
  OLTP



Exercise: Relational Model Quiz
Is a DBMS vital to the relational model?
Yes


What did the relational model replace? (multiple)
The Networking Model
The Hierchical Model


What identifier is used to uniquely identify a record
Primary Key

What is a tuple?
A row of data

What identifies the relationship between two pieces of data?
A Foreign Key

How do we lock down what can be filled into a column? (multiple)
Datatypes
Constraints
