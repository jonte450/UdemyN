Group By
Group the data by groups.
SUMMARRIZING OR AGGREGATING DATA BY GROUPS

To get in-depth information by group

Group By 
Group by splits data into groups or chunks so we can apply functions
against the group rather than the entire table.

We use Group By Almost Exclusively with Aggregate Functions.

When We "Group By" We apply the function per group, not on the entire Data set

Group By is stricter than it looks.

To Reduce All Records Found For The Matching "Group"
To A Single Record

Group By Utilizes A Split-Apply-Combine Strategy



Group By Exercises
/*
*  How many people were hired on any given hire date?
*  Database: Employees
*  Table: Employees
*/

SELECT hire_date,COUNT('hire_date') as "sum"
FROM employees
GROUP by hire_date
Order by "sum" DESC


/*
*   Show me all the employees, hired after 1991 and count the amount of positions they've had
*  Database: Employees
*/

SELECT e.emp_no,count(t.title) as "amount of titles"
FROM employees as e
join titles as t using(emp_no)
where Extract (year from e.hire_date) > 1991
GROUP by emp_no
order by emp_no;


/*
*  Show me all the employees that work in the department development

join salaries as s using(emp_no)
join dept_emp as de using(emp_no)
where de.dept_no = 'd005'
GROUP by e.emp_no
order by e.emp_no;


Having Keyword
Having is used after Grouped by.

SELECT col1, count(col2)
FROM <table>
WHERE col2 > X
GROUP By col1
HAVING col1 === Y;

"Having" Applies Filters To A Group As A Whole.

Ordering Grouped Data
Order by should come after Group by.


Group By Mental Model
We want to find answers to questions.
We want to find answerd to questions.

Select emp_no, salaray, MAX(from_date)
FROM salaries
GROUP BY emp_no, salary

We shouldn't group by salary

Select emp_no, MAX(from_date)
FROM salaries
GROUP BY emp_no

Groupings need to be unique.

SELECT emp_no, max(from_date)
FROM salaries
GROUP BY emp_no
HAVING MAX(from_date)

We can't relate the outcome of the date to the salary.


Grouping Sets

Question 
What If We Want To Combine The Results Of Multiple
Groupings?

How can we combine answers of multiple groups.

Union
Select col1, SUM(col2)
FROM table
GROUP BY col1


UNION


SELECT SUM(col2)
FROM table

If you want to run and combine multiple Select-Statements.

The Difference 
Union All Does Not Remove Duplicate Records

Select col1, SUM(col2)
FROM table
GROUP BY col1

Union All

Select SUM(col2)
FROM table


SELECT NULL AS "prod_id", sum(ol.quantity)
FROM orderlines AS ol


Union

Select prod_id, AS "prod_id", sum(ol.quantity)
FROM orderlines As ol
Group By prod_id
Order By prod_id DESC;


Select prod_id AS "prod_id" , sum(ol.quantity)
FROM orderlines AS ol
Group By
   Grouping Sets(
   ()
   (prod_id)
   )
ORDER BY prod_id DESC;

We can group sets in the same into several sets.


Grouping Sets
A Subclause of GROUP BY
That Allows You To Define
Multiple Groupings



Rollup
Groupings sets help very much if you want to know what was sold
by day,month,year.

Select Extract (YEAR FROM orderdate) AS "year",
	   Extract (MONTH FROM orderdate) AS "month",
	   Extract (DAY FROM orderdate) AS "day",
	   sum(ol.quantity)
FROM orderlines AS ol
GROUP BY
      ROLLUP(
      Extract (YEAR FROM orderdate)
      Extract (MONTH FROM orderdate)
      Extract (DAY FROM orderdate)
      )
Order BY
   Extract (YEAR FROM orderdate)
   Extract (MONTH FROM orderdate)
   Extract (DAY FROM orderdate)

It dymnically creates all the groupes for you.
Useful when you need all sorts of combinations.


Window What

What We Learned So Far
1. Grouping Data Is Useful
2. Grouping Happens After FROM/WHERE
3. Having Is A Special Filter For Groups
4. Grouping Sets And Rollups Are Useful
   For Multiple Groupings In A Single Query
5. Grouping Data Is Not A Silver Bullet


What Are We Missing
How Do We Apply Functions
Against A Set Of Rows Related To
The Current Row?

Let's Take A Example
What If You Wanted To Know
The Average Salary Per
Department?

Easy Peasy
Add The Average To Every Salary So We
Could Visually See How Much Each Employee
Is From The Average

Window Functions!


Looking Through The Window
What Now?
Window Functions Create A New Column
Based On Functions Performed On A Subset
Or "Window" Of The Data

What Now?

window_function(arg1,arg2,...)OVER(
[PARTITION BY partition_expression]
[ORDER BY sort_expression [ASC| DESC] [NULLS {FIRST | LAST}]]
)

You need this OVER keyword.

Select
      *,
      MAX(salary) OVER()
FROM salaries;


PARTITION BY

PARTITION By:
DIVIDE ROWS INTO GROUPS TO APPLY THE
FUNCTION AGAINST (OPTIONAL)

Select
	  *,
	  d.dept_name,
	  AVG(salary) OVER(
	  				PARTITION BY d.dept_name
	  )
FROM salaries
JOIN dept_emp AS de USING (emp_no)
JOIN departments AS d USING (dept_no)

Count each department salary.


Order By Acting Strange
Order By can be used within a Window function.
ORDER BY:
ORDER THE RESULTS

SELECT emp_no,
	   COUNT(salary) OVER(
	   ORDER BY emp_no
	   )

FROM salaries

ORDER has a special property like framing.
We are chaning the lense.
Taking the sum and anything before it.



Using Framin In Window Function

FRAME CLAUSE
When using a frame clause
in a window function we can
create a sub-range or frame

Key 			Meaning
Rows Or Range   Whether You Want To Use A Range OR Rows As A Frame
Preceding 		Rows Before The Current One
Following		Rows After The Current One
Unbounded Prec  Returns All Before Or After
or Foll

Current Row 	Your Current Row

PARTITION BY category ORDER BY price Range Between Unbounded Preceding
AND Current Row

Without Order By
By Default The Framing Is Usually
All Partition Rows

With Order By
By Default The Framing Is Usually
Everything Before The Current Row
And The Current Row

Adding Partition By is only looking at the case itself.
The order and partition influence each other.



Solving For Current Salaray

Select e.emp_no,
	   e.first_name,
	   d.depth_name,
	   MAX(s.salary)


FROM salaries as s

join employees as e USING(emp_no)
join dept_emp as de USING(emp_no)
JOIN departments as d USING(dept_no)

GROUP BY e.emp_no,  e.first_name, d.dept_name
order by e.emp_no;


Current Salary

We Know When Your Last Salary
Was Appointed But Not What It Was

Select DISTINCT e.emp_no,
	   e.first_name,
	   d.dept_name,
	   LAST_VALUE(s.salary) OVER(
	   PARTITION BY e.emp_no,
	   ORDER BY s.from_date
	   RANGE BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND UNBOUNDED FOLLOWING
	   ) as "Current Salary"

FROM salaries as s

JOIN employees as e USING(emp_no)
JOIN dept_emp as de USING(emp_no)
JOIN departments as d USING(dept_no)	   

ORDER BY e.emp_no;

So now we successfully answered the question to find the current salary.


FIRST_VALUE
Return A Value Evaluated Against The First
Row Within Its Partition

I Want To Know How My Price Compares
To The Item With The Lowest Price In
The Same Category

Select
	prod_id,
	price,
	category,
	first_value(price) OVER(
	PARTITION BY category ORDER BY RANGE BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING
	AND UNBOUNDED FOLLOWING
	)
FROM products



LAST_VALUE
Return A Value Evaluated Against The Last Row Within
Its Partition

I Want To Know How My Price Compares
To The Item With The Highest Price In
The Same Category.

Select
	prod_id,
	price,
	category,
	last_value(price) OVER(
	PARTITION BY category ORDER BY price RANGE BETWEEN UNBOUNDED
	PRECEDING
		AND UNBOUNDED FOLLOWING
	)
FROM products


SUM
SUM The Values Within A Group
Depending On The Framing


I Want To See How Much Cumulatively
A Customer Has Ordered At Our Store

Select
	o.orderid,
	o.customerid,
	o.netamount,
	SUM(o.netamount) OVER(
	PARTITION BY o.customerid
	ORDER BY o.orderid
	) as "cum sum"
FROM orders as o
ORDER BY o.customerid

Take the previous and current and sum.


ROW_NUMBER
Number The Current Row Within
The Partition Starting From 1
Regardless Of Framing

I Want To Know Where My Product
Is Positioned In the Category
By Price

Select
 	prod_id,
 	price,
 	category,
 	row_number() OVER(PARTITION BY category ORDER BY price) as "position in
 	category by price"
    FROM products

Conditional Statements
What If You Only Want To
Select Something When A Certain
Criteria Is Met?

Select a,
	   CASE WHEN a=1 THEN 'one'
	        WHEN a=2 THEN 'two'
	        ELSE 'other'
	    END

Case Statements Can Be Used
In Multiple Places In A Query

Each Return Must Be A
Single OutPut

Select

	o.customerid,
	CASE
	   WHEN o.customerid = 1
	   THEN 'my first customer'
	   ELSE 'not my first customer'

Views...What Are They Good For?
What If I Want To Store The
Results Of A Query?


What If I Want To Query
The Results Of A Query?


Views Allow You To Store And Query
Previously Run Queries

There Are 2 Types Of Views
Materialized And Non-Materialized

Non-Materialized Views
Query Gets Re-Run Each Time
The View Is Called On


Materialized Views
Stores The Data Physically And
Periodically updates it When Tables Change



View Syntax
CREATE VIEW view_name AS query;

Views Are The Output
Of The Query We Ran

Views Act Like Tables
You Can Query Them

Views Take Very Little Space To Store
We Only Store The Definition Of A View
Not All Of The Data That it Returns


Updating A View

Create OR Replace <view name>
AS query


Rename A View

Alter View <view name> Rename To <view name>;

Deleting A View

DROP VIEW [IF EXISTS] <view name>


Using Syntax
Getting The Most Recent
Salary Of An Employee

Current Salary
Group By Didn't Really Give Us
A Correct Outcome

Select e.emp_no,
	   e.first_name,
	   d.dept_name,
	   MAX(s.salary)


FROM salaries as s

join employees as e USING(emp_no)
join dept_emp as de USING(emp_no)
JOIN departments as d USING(dept_no)

GROUP BY e.emp_no, e.first_name, d.dept_name
order by e.emp_no;

Using Window Functions We
Could Pull Off Some Voodoo Magic

Select distinct e.emp_no,
				e.first_name,
				d.dept_name,
				LAST_VALUE(s.salart) OVER(
				PARTITION BY e.emp_no
				ORDER BY s.from_date
				RANGE BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND UNBOUNDED FOLLOWING
				) as "Current Salary"

FROM salaries as s

JOIN employees as e USING(emp_no)
JOIN dept_emp as de USING(emp_no)
JOIN departments as d USING(dept_no)

ORDER BY e.emp_no;

But this isn't really intuitive,
so how about we try views!

Current Salary
Create View last_salary_change AS
Select e.emp_no,
	   Max(s.from_date)

FROM salaries as s

join employess as e USING(emp_no)
join dept_emp as de USING(emp_no)
join departments as d USING(dept_no)

Group By e.emp_no;
Order By e.emp_no;

We can query views as normal table.
It becomes more and more eaiser to create complex queries.


Views Exercises
/*
*  Create a view "90-95" that:
*  Shows me all the employees, hired between 1990 and 1995

Select *
from employees as e
Where EXTRACT(year from e.hire_date) BETWEEN 1990 and 1995

Indexes

What's Is An Index
An Index Is A Construct
To Improve Querying Performance

Think Of It Like A Table Of Contents
It Helps You Find Where A Piece Of Data Is

Speed Up Queries

Slows Down Data Insertion And Updates

Types Of Indexes
-Single-Column
-Multi-Column
-Unique
-Partial
-Implicit Indexes

Creating A Index
Create Unique Index <name>
on <table> (column1,column2, ...);

Delete A Index
Drop Index <name>;

When To Use
-Index Foreign Keys
-Index Primary Keys And Unique Columns
-Index On Columns That End Up In The Order By/Where Clause often


When Not To Use
-Don't Add An Index Just To Add An Index
-Don't Use Indexes On Small Tables
-Don't Use On Tables That Are Updated Frequently
-Don't Use On Columns That Can Contain Null Values
-Don't Use On Columns That Have Large Values



Index Types
Single-Column
Most Frequently Used
Column In A Query

Multi-Column
Most Frequently Used
Columns In A Query

When To Use
Single-Column:
Retrieving Data That Satisfies One Condition

Multi-Column:
Retrieving Data That Satisfies Multiple Conditions

Unique
For Speed And Integrity 
Create Unique Index <name>
on <table> (column1);

Partial
Index Over A Subset Of A Table 
Create Index <name>
on <table> (<expression>);

Implicit
Automatically Created By The
Database
-Primary Key
-Unique Key



Index Algorithms
Any type of data may need a type of lookup.

Postgresql Provides Several Types Of Indexes
-B-Tree
-Hash
-Gin
-Gist
Each Index Type Uses A Different Algorithm

Create [Unique] Index <name>
ON <table> Using <method> (column1, ...)

Each of these algorithm have special use case.

B-Tree
Default Algorithm!
Best Used For Comparisions With
-<
-<=
-=
->=
-Between
-IN
-IS NULL
-IS NOT NULL

HASH
Can Only Handle Equality (=)
Operations


GIN
Generalized Inverted Index

Best Used When Multiple Values
Are Stored In A Single Field


GIST 
Generalized Search Tree
Useful In Indexing Geometric Data
And Full-Text Search


What Are Subqueries?
A Construct That Allows You
To Build Extremly Complex
Queries

Also Called An Inner Query
Or Inner Select

It's A Query Within Another SQL
Query Most Often Found In The
Where Clause

Select *
From <table>
Where <column> <condition>(
  Select <column>, <column>, ...
  From <table>
  [Where | Group By | Order By | ...]
)


We want filter against the resultat

You Can Also Use It In The 
Select,From And Having Clause

Select(
	Select <column>, <column>, ...
	From <table>
	[Where | Group By | Order By | ...]
)-- must return a single record
From <table> AS <name>



Select *
From <table> AS <name>
Group By <column>
Having(
 --must return a single record
 Select <column>, <column>, ...
 From <table>
 [Where | Group By | Order By | ...]

) > X

You will proably use one column only.



Subqueries vs Joins

Both Subqueries And Joins
Combine Data From Different
Tables

Subqueries Are Queries
That Could Stand Alone


Joins Combine Rows From One Or
More Tables Based On A Match
Condition

Subqueries can return one result or multiple results

Subquery VS Join
Subqueries Can Return
A Single Result Or A Row Set

Joins Can Only Return A Row Set

A Subquery's Results
Are Immediately used

A Joined Table Can Be Used In
The Outer Query


Subqueries Guidelines As Types
Select (
	Select <column> , <column>, ...
	FROM <table>
	[Where | Group By | Order By | ...]
)
FROM <table> AS <name>

A Subquery Must Be Enclosed In Parentheses

Select *
FROM <table> AS <name>
Where X >= (
		Select MAX(<column>)
		From <table>
		[Where | Group By | Order By]
		)

Must Be Placed On The Right Side Of
The Comparison Operator


Cannot Manipulate Their Results Internally
(Order By Ignored)


Select *
From <table> AS <name>
Where X >= | <= | = | != (
	Select MAX(<column>)
	From <table>
	[Where | Group By | Order By | ...]
)

Use Single-Row Operators With Single-Row Subqueries

Subqueries That Return Null May
Not Return Results

Types Of Subqueries
-Single Row
-Multiple Row
-Multiple Column
-Correlated
-Nested

Single Row
Select name,salary
From salaries
Where salary =
	(Select AVG(salary) From salaries)

Return Zero Or One Row
Adding as extra column

Multiple Row


Select title, price, category
From products
Where category IN(
	Select category FROM categories
	Where categoryname IN ('Comedy', 'Family', 'Classics')
)

Returns One Or More Rows

Multiple Column

Select emp_no, salary, dev.avg AS "Department average salary"
From salaries AS s
Join dept_emp AS de USING(emp_no)
Join(
	Select dept_no, AVG(salary), FROM salaries AS s2
	JOIN dept_emp AS e USING(emp_no)
	Group By dept_no
)AS dea USING(dept_no)
Where salary > dea.avg

Returns One or More Columns

Correlated

Select emp_no, salary, from_date
From salaries AS s
Where from_date = (
	Select max(s2.from_date) AS max
	FROM salaries AS s2
	Where s2.emp_no = s.emp_no
)
Order By emp_no

Reference One Or More Columns In The
Outer Statement - Against Each Row

Nested

Select orderlineid, prod_id, quantity
From orderlines
Join(
	Select prod_id
	From products
	Where category IN(
	Select category FROM categories
	Where category_name IN ('Comedy', 'Family', 'Classics')
	)
) as limited USING (prod_id)

Subquery In A Subquery


Using Subqueries
Show All Employees Older
Than The Average Age

Select
	first_name,
	LAST_name,
	AGE(birth_date)
FROM employees
Where AGE(birth_date) > (Select AVG(age(birth_date)) From
employees)

Show The Title By Salary
For Each Employee

Select
	emp_no,
	salary,
	from_date,
	(Select title From titles AS t
	--Referencing outside -- Correlated subquery
	Where t.emp_no = s.emp_no AND t.from_date = s.from_date)
	From salaries AS s
	Order By emp_no

Show The Most Recent Employees Salary



Quick Note: Titles For Employees

In the video "Using Subqueries" we see a query where we try to apply combine titles with salaries to see the salary changes per title live. In the video "Inner Join" we stated that each title change happens 2 days AFTER a salary bump.



Our query did not take this fact into account and so for each employee we would only see the initial title, but not the subsequent title changes. In order to address this we need to add the following to the query:



select emp_no, salary, from_date, 
    (select title from titles as t 
     where t.emp_no=s.emp_no and 
    (t.from_date = s.from_date + interval '2 days' or t.from_date=s.from_date))
from salaries as s
order by emp_no;


This will catch both the cases where the initial title was given and any salaries linked to a subsequent title change!



Getting The Latest Salaries

Show The Most Recent Employees Salary

Select
	emp_no,
	salary AS "most recent salary",
	from_date
From salaries AS s
Where from_date = (
	Select MAX(from_date)
	From salaries AS sp
	--Correlated subquery
	Where sp.emp_no = s.emp_no
)
Order By emp_no ASC
This solution take too long.
Joining is less expensive to do.



Subquery Operators
Operators That You Can
Apply In The Where-Clause
On Subqueries

Exists
Select firstname, lastname, income
FROM customers as c
Where Exists(
Select * From orders as o
Where c.customerid = o.customerid AND totalamount > 400
)AND income > 90000

Check If The Subquery Returns Any Rows


IN
Select prod_id
From products
Where category IN(
	Select category From categories
	Where categoryname IN ('Comedy', 'Family', 'Classics')
)
Check If The Value Is Equal To Any Of
The Rows In The Return (Null Yields Null)

Not In

Select prod_id
FROM products
Where category IN(
	Select category From categories
	Where category_name NOT IN('Comedy','Family','Classics')
)

Check If The Value Is Not Equal To Any Of
The Rows In The Return (Null Yields Null)


ANY/SOME

Select prod_id
From products
Where category = ANY (
		Select category From categories
		Where categoryname IN ('Comedy','Family','Classics')
)

Check Each Row Against The Operator
And If Any Comparision Matches Return True


ALL
Select prod_id, title ,sales
From products
Join inventory as i Using(prod_id)
Where i.sales > ALL (
    Select AVG(sales) From inventory
    Join products as p1 Using (prod_id)
    Group By p1.category
)

Check Each Row Against The Operator
And If All Comparision Match Return True

Single Value Comparision

Select prod_id
From products
Where category = (
	Select category From categories
	Where categoryname IN ('Comedy')
)

Subquery Must Return A Single Row
Check Comparator Against Row
