Berfore We Get Started

Throughout this section, you will find that we are taking a slightly different approach.

When we approached querying it was beneficial to learn the concepts and what they do, applying them to certain scenarios.

Doing all that before touching on exercises builds a solid foundation for applying knowledge.

However, there are many different strategies to employ effective learning, throughout this bootcamp we’ve enjoyed everything from history to theory and practical exercises. In this section, you will find a healthy mix.

From the get-go our plan was to build a solid foundation for you to start off your SQL mastery, as with any technology there are multiple avenues to walk when exploring SQL.

The avenue of data creation and management is one that often crosses the realm of architecture and administrator. You see on the one hand you have the definition and creation of databases and the relationships between different tables and on the other hand, you have the management of roles, permissions, backups, and so forth.

Very different skills indeed, nevertheless extremely valuable to know and use, SQL is so much more than just querying data - it’s a lifestyle! I joke, but I also digress.

Throughout this section what you will find is a healthy mix of theory and practical application when it comes to management and the principles, as well as a practical example of database architecture and creation.

There are many commands to master in this section, but the reality is once you go out there and start applying these skills that’s when the real learning will start, the foundation this course gives you sets you up for a life long journey of fun problem-solving with SQL!

Types Of Databases In A RDBMS
-Regular
-Template

Databases management.
In a startup you can do multiple things.
If you are on operation you may
doing sharding, replication, backups
database.

Template tells how to make a database.
Template is a blueprint.

When You Setup Your Postgres 3 Databases Were Created
-Postgres
-Template0
-Template1




Default PostGreSQL
When you setup the databases three things is setup.
-Postgres
-Template0
-Template1

Data is something that continues to expand.

Postgres Database
This Is The Default Database That Is
Created When You Setup Postgres (INITDB)

Postgres Database
So The First Time You Initialize
Postgres You Can Connect To The
Postgres Database To Setup
Your First Database

psql -U <user> <database>

Postgres Database
Postgres By Default Will Assume
A Connection To A Database
With The Same Name As The User
If No Database Is Supplied

psql -U postgres
postgres-# \conninfo
You are Connected To database "postgres" as user "postgres"
via socket in "/tmp" at port "5432".

This Command Shows You Your Current
Connection

Template0 Database
This Is The Template That Is
Used To Create Template1 - Never Change It

Template0




Template Databases

Template0 Database
This Is The Template That Is
Used To Create Template1 - Never Change It

Template0

It is the backup for Template1.

It is essence a backup Template

Template1 Database
This Is The Template That Is
Used To Create New Databases

Any Changes We Make To The Template
Are Automatically Applied To All
New Databases

One Thing To Note Is That Because Template1
Is The Default Template - If It Is Being
Accessed/Connected To No New Databases
Can Be Created Until The Connection Is
Closed!

psql -U postgres template1


\conninfo 


Template Databases
You Can Create Your Own
Template Database To Create
Other Databases With This Is
However Not Very Common!

Create Database mysuperdupertemplate;
--connect to mysuperdupertemplate and run

Create Table superdupertable();
--after creating the database connect to it
--and  you will see superdupertable



Creating A Database
Create Database Name
[[With] [Owner] [=] user_name]
		[Template [=] [template]]
		[Encoding [=] encoding]
		[LC_Collate [=] lc_collate]
		[LC_TYPE [=] lc_type]
		[TableSpace [=] tablespace]
		[CONNECTION LIMIT [=] connlimit]

Setting 		 Default
Template 		 template0
Encoding 		 UTF8
Connection Limit 100
Owner			 Current User

Let's Create An Example Database To
Store Courses!

Database Organization
Databases Often Contain Many Tables,
View,ETC... Depending On How Much You
Care, You May Want To Organize Them
In A Logical Way!




Database Organization
Postgres Schemas
Postgres Offers The Concept of "Schemas"
Think Of It Like A Box In Which You Can
Organize Tables, Views, Indexes, ETC.

By Default Each Database Get's A "Public" Schema

Unless You Specify A Schema
The Default Is Always Assumed To
Be Public!

Select * From employees
-- is the same as
Select * From public.employees

To Show all Schemas
\dn

To Create Schemas
Create Schema Sales;

Reasons To Use Schemas
-To Allow Many Users To Use One Database
 Without Interfering With Each Other

-To Organize Database Objects Into Logical
 Groups To Make Them More Manageable

-Third-Party Applications Can Be Put Into
 Separate Schemas So They Do Not Collide
 With The Names Of Other Objects.

Restricted 
Creating Databases Is A Restricted Action
Not Everyone Is Allowed To Do It!


Roles In Postgre
Roles Are Vital To Any DBMS They Determine
What's Allowed!

A Role Can Be A User Or A Group
It Depends On How You Setup The
Role

Roles Have The Abiltity To Grant Membership
To Another Role



Role Attributes And Creation

Role Attribute 
When A Role Is Created It Is Given
Certain Attributes

The Priviliges Of A Role Are
Determined In Part By Its
Attributes

Give A Role Certain Commands Rights.

Attribute 				Purpose
Login Privilige 		A role with the LOGIN
						attribute can be
						Considered the same
						thing as a "database user"


Superuser Status		A Database superuser bypasses
						all permission checks


Database Creation 		A role must be explicity given
						permission to create databases

Role Creation 			A role must be explicity given
						permission to create more roles

Password 				A password is only significant
						if you give LOGIN privilige


Creating Role

Create Role readonly WITH LOGIN ENCRYPTED PASSWORD 'readonly';

Always Encrypt When Storing A Role That Can Log In

View Roles
\du

Creating Role
By Default Only The Creator Of The Database
Or Superuser Has Access To Its Objects


Creating Users And Configuring Login
CREATE role test_role_login WITH LOGIN ENCRYPTED PASSWORD 'password';

CREATE USER test_user_with_login WITH ENCRYPTED PASSWORD 'password';

\du

createuser --interactive

 psql -U test_interctive Employees -W

 pg_hba.conf is a file that allows connections.

postgressql.conf

show hba_file: This command tells where you can find these files.
Change Method From Trust in method will tell PSQL to use password.



Priviliges
Attributes Can Only Define So Many Privliges!
When You Are Not A "Superuser"
What You Can Do Is Fairly Limited
Depending On What Default Privileges
Are Set

By Default Objects Are Only Available
To The One Who Creates Them

This Means Privileges Need To
Be Granted For New Roles And
Users To Have Access To Certain
Data

Granting Priviliges And Role Management

Grant All Priviliges ON <table> TO <user>
Grant All On All Tables [IN Schema <schema>] To <user>;
Grant [Select, Update, Insert, ...] ON <table> [IN Schema <schema>] TO
<user>;

Be Wise About The Priviliges You Grant!

createuser --interactive
psql -U privilegetest Employees
\conninfo
Grant Select On titles TO privilegetest
Revoke Select On Titles From privilegetest;

Grant All On All Tables IN Schema public To Priviligetest






Best Practices For Role Management
When Managing Roles And Permissions
Always Go With The "Principle Of Least Privilege"

Don't Use Admin/Superuser By Default!



Data Types & Boolean Type

Before We Create A Full-Fledged Database
It's Important To Know What Types Of Data
We Can Store In A Database

Data Types

When We Talk About The Types Of Data
We Can Store We Categorize Them
Into Buckets Or "Types"

Type
-Numeric Types
-Arrays
-Character Types
-Data/Time Types
-Boolean Types
-UUID Type

Check the DOCS for which types

A Data Type Is Nothing More Than
A Constraint Place On A Field To
Only Allow That Type Of Data To
Be Filled In

Specyfying A Type Is Important
Because It Tells The System How
It Can/Should Handle The Data In
That Field

It's Also What Allows The DBMS
To Optimize Its Algorithms For
Processing Data By Knowing Its
Type

Boolean 
A Boolean Type Can Hold True False Or Null


Storing Text

Character
Postgresql Provides Three Character Data Types:
Char(n), Varchar(n), And Text

Char(n)
Fixed length with space padding


Varchar(n)
Variable length with no padding

Text
Unlimited length text


Storing Numbers

Numeric
There Are 2 Types Of Numbers In Postgres:
Integers And Floating Points

Integers
A Whole Number, A Number That Is Not A Fraction

There Are 3 Types:
Smallint, Int, Bigint

Smallint
Number That Can Range From
-32,768 to 32,767


Int
Number That Can Range From
-2,147,483,648 To 2,147,483,643


Bigint
Number That Can Range From
-9223372036854775808 
 To 9223372036854775808

We are trying to save space.

Floating Point
Simply Put, Numbers That Can
Contain A Decimal Point

Float4/Float8

Single Or Double Precision
Meaning 6 or 15 Digits Precision

Decimal/Numeric
Up To 131072 Digits Before The Decimal Point;Up
To 16383 Digits After The Decimal Point


Storing Arrays

Arrays
An Array Is Nothing More Than
A Group Of Elements Of The Same
Type

An Array Is Denoted By A Bracket Syntax

Every Data Type In Postgres
Has An Array Equivalent



Data Models And Naming Conventions

Let's Create Data!
We've Created Our Database
Al That's Left To Do Is Put
Data In It Right?

Before We Start
Hold Up!
What Do We Put In?

Database Models
Well Usually Before Creating
A Database We Create A Model!

What's A Model

Important Note

A Model Is A Design That Is
Used To Visualize What We Are
Going To Build!

Important Note
We've Seen A Lot Of Different
Sample Databases So Far

Important Note
A Lot Of Them Do Not Follow
The Best Practices!

Important Note
Now That We're Modelling Our
Own Database It's Important
To Follow The Common Standards!

Naming Conventions
Table Names Must Be Singular!

Columns Must Be Lowercase
With Underscores

Columns With Mixed Case
Are Acceptable

Columns With Upper Case
Are Unaccetpable

Be Consistent!
Write Down Your Rules!




Create Table

Let's Create Data!
So Now That We Know
What Rules We're going
To Follow Let's Create A Table

Create Table

Create Table <Name> (
 <col1> Type [Constraint]m
 table_constraint [CONSTRAINT]
)[Inherits <existing_table>];

Student
Create Table Student(
student_id UUID Primary Key Default uuid_generate_v4(),
first_name VARCHAR(255) Not Null,
last_name VARCHAR(255), Not Null,
email VARCHAR(255), Not Null,
date_of_birth Date Not Null
);


We have to connect: psql -U postgres ztm


Extra Information on Create TABLE

The CREATE TABLE statement is the most important command when making a database, depending on the DBMS you are using the options may vary heavily. In Postgres there are many things you can do with this statement.

We wanted to leave a couple of notes on the creation syntax!

Normal tables

By default any time you run the CREATE TABLE command you will be creating an object in the public schema, unless otherwise specified.

Think of database design like drafting a blueprint for a house, and when you’re creating a table you’re drafting a blueprint for a specific room. What you put on that blueprint will determine how that room is going to look!

In our videos you saw us using this syntax to create many different tables with varying constraints, types and keys.

For the most part creating tables is the easy part, the hardest part is drafting the blueprint upfront so that you know what steps to follow. This is why database design and modelling is so crucial.

Temporary tables
One thing we did not touch on during these videos is the ability to create temporary tables. They are a type of table that exist in a special schema, so you cannot define a schema name when declaring a temporary table.


These types of tables will be dropped at the end of your session. It’s important to also note that they are only visible to the creator.

Now you may be wondering, why would I ever use these? Well if you’re writing intensive queries against a data set it might be beneficial to temporarily create a table based off another table.

This is because:

Temporary tables behave just like normal ones

Postgres will apply less “rules” (logging, transaction locking, etc.) to temporary tables so they execute more quickly

You have full access rights to the data, if you otherwise didn’t so you can test things out.

Column Constraints

Constraints
Constraints Are A Tool
To Apply Validation Methods
Against Data That Will Be Inserted

Column Constraints
A Column Constraint Is Defined As
Part Of A Column Definition.

Constraint
-Not Null: Cannot Be Null
-Primary Key: Column Will Be The Primary Key
-Unique: Can Only Contain Unique Values (NULL is Unique)
-Check: Apply a special condition check against the
		values in the column

-References: Constrain the values of the column to only
			 be values that exist in the column of 
			 another table(Foreign Key)




Table Constraints

A Table Constraint Definition Is
Not Tied To A Particular Column,
And It Can Encompass More Than
One Column.

Constraint
Unique(column_list): Can only contain Unique values (NULL is Unique)
Primary Key(column_list): Columns that will be the primary key
Check(condition): A condition to check when inserting or updating
References: Foreign key relationships to a column

Create Table student (
student_id UUID Default uuid_generate_v4(),
first_name VARCHAR(255) Not Null,
last_name VARCHAR(255) Not Null,
email VARCHAR(255) Not Null,
date_of_birth Date Not Null,
Constraint pk_student_id Primary Key (student_id)
);


Note That
Every Column Constraint Can
Be Written As A Table Constraint

You can use a Regex to try to match with Check constraint.


Regexes!

When it comes to Regular Expressions there are many avenues to take to learn and apply this skill. It in itself is a language that crosses the barriers of each programming language and can be used to validate complex text patterns. Regex comes in multiple "flavours" or what we would like to call "variations".

It usually finds its place in applying validations to make sure what a user is inputting matches an expectation. That expectation could be anything:

An e-mail

A phone number

An address

A postal code

When it comes to data we often have unique ways of writing these things, and they vary from country to country so it is extremely important to be able to know what inputs are expected and validate/sanitize inputs so they match your expectation.

Different languages can have slight variations on how they choose to implement Regex, but they often do not differ heavily.

At the end of the day, what we want to achieve is clean data and we have all of these mechanisms in place to help us, writing constraints is a hard job. For learning Regex there are thousands of resources that can teach you, help you verify and supercharge your skills. We've curated a list here of learning resources that we found extremely valuable and helpful:



Regex for regular folk - A fun, illustrative and simple guide to learning regex

Regex Crossword - Challenging puzzles to practice your Regex-fu

Regex Search - A tool to find quick and easy regex references

Regex Tester - A Regex testing tool that supports multiple flavours




UUID Explained
Using UUID FIELDS
Create extension IF NOT EXISTS "uuid-ossp"
We Need To Install An Extension


Extensions
Select * From pg_available_extensions;

These Are Pieces Of Software That Allow
You To Expand What Postgres Can Do Or
Expand How Certain Processes Run

UUID
This Extension Allows Us To
Generate Unique Identifiers
For Primary Keys

UUID Stands For Universally
Unique Indentifier

'a9839a1f-edf5-4a77-9fde-b0dac8ea32d5'

UUID
PROS
-Unique 
-It's easier to shard
-It's easier merge/replicate
-You expose less information
 about your system

Cons
-Larger values to store
-Can have performance impact
-More difficult to debug
