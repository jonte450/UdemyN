Stacks + Queues Introduction
We are going to learn stacks and queues.
They are both linear data structure.
Only one data element can be directly reached.
They both can be implemented on similar ways.
There are no random access.
Why would we use something like this.
Less methods.
Limit the opertions can be benefit.
You can control the one that use the data structure it can be more easiy to contol the use limitation.

Stacks
lookup O(n)
pop O(1)
push O(1)
peek O(1)

You can think them as plates one piece of data comes.
Plates that are stacked over each other.
Keep going until you goes through the stack.
LIFO.
Why are they useful.
Stacks are very important in engines.
Most programming languages are modeled with stacks.
Functions within functions.
Browser history hit the front bottom.
Write a piece of text and undo.
You store the previous states.

pop 
remove the last item.

pop 
add an item.


Queues

lookup O(n)
enqueue O(1)
dequeue O(1)
peek O(1)

Best way to think on them is to think them as a roller coaster.
It is the opposite of stacks.
FIFO get's accessed first first out.
Resturant app using queues.
Uber are using queues.
Printers press print.
The person that clicks prints first should print first.

enqueue to add an person in line.
dequeue to remove a person in line.
peek tells what's the first item in the list.
lookup you usally not does.

It is very effcient to build an queue with an array.

Exercise: Stacks VS Queues
There two ways to build stacks and queues.

//Stacks

//google
//udemy.com
//youtube

twiter
youtube
udemy.com
google 

Stacks has an top and a bottom.

//Arrays

//Linked List


//Queues

Matt -- Joy -- Samir -- Pavel 

We want Matt to be first.

Which one should be better.

//Arrays
//Linked Lists

Solution: Stacks VS Queues
Stacks they can be implemented with arrays and linked lists.
Arrays allows cache-locality.
Linked Lists have more dynamic memory.

Queues you would never want to build with an array.
Arrays has indexes associated with them.
When we remove Matt then we have to shift all the others elements.
O(n^(2)) operations.
Linked Lists all have a pointer to the head and the tail.

Quick Note: Upcomming Video

Javascript as a language gives a great demonstration of how Stacks and Queues work. If you would like to be a little bit more familiar with how they work or how things like "Stackoverflow" happen, I have added an extra video from one of my other courses: The Complete Web Developer: Zero to Mastery which goes over this topic in the next lecture.

If you are already familiar with this topic you can skip over to the Exercise: Stack Implementation video.

Optional: How JavaScript Works
We don't need to know how JavaScript works.
Let's start.
What is a program.
We have to allocate memory.
From our previous section.
We have the V8 engine.
The engine consists of two parts.
-Memory Heap
-Call Stack

We aslo know that the JavaScript Engine reads the JavaScript.
The memory heap where the memory allocation.

const a = 1;
const b = 10;
const c = 100;
JavaScript Engine is going to remeber the variables.
Increasing the number of variables is going to cause memory leak.
That's why global variables are bad.

Call Stack.
console.log('1');
console.log('2');
console.log('3');

What's the call stack reads the first line.
Let's pop it up.
Run 1 and console.log(1) and so on.

We have two functions.

//Call Stack
console.log(4);
two();
one();

Run console.log 4 and remove it from the call stack.

JavaScript is a single-threaded language.
It can only do one thing at the time.
Others language can have multithreaded call stacks.
You can have things like deadlocks.
You may have heard of the site of stackOverflow.
When a stack is over-flown.
When the call-stack becomes bigger and bigger.
We can reach a stackoverflow if we have recursions without any base-cases.

We need something non-blocking.
Ideally we don't wait around.
Think Asynchronous as a behaviour.
Image-processing we need something like asycnhronous task.
Set-timeout.
In order of JavaScript to run we have JavaScript enviroment.
-Web-Api
-Call Stack
-Callback Queue
-Event-Loop

It triggers the web-api.
Web-Api starts a timer.

Event-loop keeps checking the Callback-Queue.
Console.log(2) it's going run the function.


Exercise: Stack Implementation (Linked List)
It is time to code our own first stack.
this.top, this.bottom,this.length.

I have created the template.

Implement peek(),push(),pop().

Solution: Stack Implementation (Linked List)
Not my solution:
My Solution is in a separate file:

Peek should be very easy to implement.
Just return return this.top.
Push value we wanna check if this is the very first item.
this.length === 0.
We reference the top and the bottom to the new node.
Peek testing.
Next is null becasuse we only have one item.
With a Stack push discord.

Let's continue with pop.
If we have null we just return null.
What's we just did was to pop.
We just to add one conditional just.


class Node {
  constructor(value){
    this.value = value;
    this.next = null;
  }
}

class Stack {
  constructor(){
    this.top = null;
    this.bottom = null;
    this.length = 0;
  }
  peek() {
    return this.top;
  }
  push(value){
    const newNode = new Node(value);
    if (this.length === 0) {
      this.top = newNode;
      this.bottom = newNode;
    } else {
      const holdingPointer = this.top;
      this.top = newNode;
      this.top.next = holdingPointer;
    }
    this.length++;
    return this;
  }
  pop(){
    if (!this.top) {
      return null;
    }
    if (this.top === this.bottom) {
      this.bottom = null;
    }
    const holdingPointer = this.top;
    this.top = this.top.next;
    this.length--;
    return this;
  }
  //isEmpty
}

const myStack = new Stack();
myStack.peek();
myStack.push('google');
myStack.push('udemy');
myStack.push('discord');
myStack.peek();
myStack.pop();
myStack.pop();
myStack.pop();


//Discord
//Udemy
//google

Exercise: Stack Implementation (Array)
Convert the previous to use a Array instead.

Solution: Stack Implementation (Array)
When we do a peek we just wanna see the latest thing.


class Stack {
  constructor(){
    this.array = [];
  }

  peek() {
    return this.array[this.array.length-1];
  }
  push(value){
    this.array.push(value);
    return this;
  }
  pop(){
    this.array.pop();
    return this;
  }
}

const myStack = new Stack();
myStack.peek();
myStack.push('google');
myStack.push('udemy');
myStack.push('discord');
myStack.peek();
myStack.pop();
myStack.pop();
myStack.pop();


//Discord
//Udemy
//google

Exercise: Queue Implementation
Implementing peek(), enqueue(), dequeue().

Solution: Queue Implementation
Not my solution!
My solution in a different repository:

class Node {
  constructor(value) {
    this.value = value;
    this.next = null;
  }
}

class Queue {
  constructor(){
    this.first = null;
    this.last = null;
    this.length = 0;
  }
  peek() {
    return this.first;
  }
  enqueue(value){
    const newNode = new Node(value);
    if (this.length === 0) {
      this.first = newNode;
      this.last = newNode;
    } else {
      this.last.next = newNode;
      this.last = newNode;
    }
    this.length++;
    return this;
  }
  dequeue(){
    if (!this.first) {
      return null;
    }
    if (this.first === this.last) {
      this.last = null;
    }
    const holdingPointer = this.first;
    this.first = this.first.next;
    this.length--;
    return this;
  }
  //isEmpty;
}

const myQueue = new Queue();
myQueue.peek();
myQueue.enqueue('Joy');
myQueue.enqueue('Matt');
myQueue.enqueue('Pavel');
myQueue.peek();
myQueue.dequeue();
myQueue.dequeue();
myQueue.dequeue();
myQueue.peek();


Queues Using Stacks
Implement a Queue using a stack interview question.
Able to see the solution.
Very easy.
Go to Stacks.

class CrazyQueue {
  constructor() {
    this.first = [];
    this.last = [];
  }

  enqueue(value) {
    const length = this.first.length;
    for (let i = 0; i < length; i++) {
      this.last.push(this.first.pop());
    }
    this.last.push(value);
    return this;
  }

  dequeue() {
    const length = this.last.length;
    for (let i = 0; i < length; i++) {
      this.first.push(this.last.pop());
    }
    this.first.pop();
    return this;
  }
  peek() {
    if (this.last.length > 0) {
      return this.last[0];
    }
    return this.first[this.first.length - 1];
  }
}

const myQueue = new CrazyQueue();
myQueue.peek();
myQueue.enqueue('Joy');
myQueue.enqueue('Matt');
myQueue.enqueue('Pavel');
myQueue.peek();
myQueue.dequeue();
myQueue.dequeue();
myQueue.dequeue();
myQueue.peek();

Stacks + Queues Review
Simply think on them as plates or queues.
Access the very first item.
We are only interested in the end-points of the data-structures.

Pros
Fast Operations
Fast Peek
Ordered

Cons
Slow LookUP
