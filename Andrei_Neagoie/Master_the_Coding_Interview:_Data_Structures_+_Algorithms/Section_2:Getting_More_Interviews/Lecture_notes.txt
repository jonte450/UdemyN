HackerNews Who is Hiring (You will need to search for most recent month)

AngelList

Seen: One company that I think is doing something interesting and may help you get a job is Seen by Indeed.

Seen is a platform that helps software engineers find jobs at top tech companies. It's 100% free for all candidates (students) and gives you Career Coaching, Resume Review, Interview Prep and Salary Negotiation.. they charge the recruiter, so if you are a good candidate, they get you hired and they make money through the company and not you... (it's free to you).  Seen tries to find a job from their list of 10,000 companies.

Evaluate if this is something you might want to attempt but I know a few people who have had a good experience with this... keep in mind this is an affiliate link but I think they are doing something great: click here to check it out
