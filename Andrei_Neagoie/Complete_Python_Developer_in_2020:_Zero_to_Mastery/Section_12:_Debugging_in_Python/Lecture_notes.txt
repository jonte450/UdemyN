How To Debug Code
Nobody writes perfect programms.
Programms are full of errors.
The act of removing the bugs.
Figiuring why it dosen't works.

#linting
Allows us to detect.
num + 4 notices hey there is undefined num.
You are using Sublime code

#ide / editor
Has these built-in.
It allows us to detect errors before we are running code.

#read errors
4 + 'asdskfm'
This is giving us a type:error.
Being able to read errors is very important.

#pdb
It's an built-in module.
It's extrememly useful.

def add(num1,num2):
	pdb.set_trace)
	return num1 + num2

pdb gives us a extra boost.
It gives a debugger.
num1 = 4
num2 = ksdfldsk

type in help you get's command you can use in the terminal.
We also have step.
Step allows us to get to the next line.

a gives us the arguments.
w gives us the context.
You are also able to change variables.
