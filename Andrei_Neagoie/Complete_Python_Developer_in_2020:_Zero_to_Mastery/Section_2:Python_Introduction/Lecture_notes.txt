What is A Programming Language
Programmin is simple we give instructions to an computer.
Wouldn't be able to play pokemon.
Computer dosen't speak english.
They speak in 1 or 0.
Humans have developing programming languages.
Some languages are closer.
There are lots of programming languages.
What are we missing.
Website to show information.
Get these files into 1 or 0.
We need an translater.
Translater and also understands machines languages.
What is the translater.
It can either be a interpreter or compiler.
Compiler reads all things all at once.
Interprator takes line by line.

Python Interpreter
Programming language is just  a set of codes that we are giving to an translator. We need an Machine that reads Python.
Understands why we are doing things.
You should be able to teach.
Different languages has different ways to.
Afterwards you learn an language things becomes easier an easier.
We are going into deep topics.
Talking about the implementation.
Translation machines we can have different compilers and interpretors.
The actual language you are downloading is C code.
Most people talks about cpython.
PY
Interpretator
Machine Code
Cypython VM
1 or 0.

How To Run Python Code
How can we finally run python code.
Proffesional setup with Python.
Terminal 
Where we can run python.

Code Editors

IDEs

Notebooks

Good to have the skills to approach.
These tools you has to install different.
All of us to start right the way.
repl.it favorite tools and allows you to save python files online.
Name your repl.
You only need an connection.
Folders for Python structure.
Glot.io
Take your time.

Our First Python Program
So what is our first program going to do.
print('Andrei Neagoie')
You can change font size.
It runs this piece code on the right side.
We have Andrei Neagoie.
We have our main.py to the interpretator and after that in Cpython JVM.
Input is going to give us a way to capture information
input('What is your name?').
We can store information.

name = input('What is your name?')

print(name)
This is not pure magic.
We gives this code our interpretator.

Convert code to bytecode.

Python 2 vs Python 3
You encounter this topic it is unvoidable.
Python is created by a human.
Programming language are constantly evolving.
To make it better and better.
Python was created in 1991.
And in 2008 Python 2 had something they wanted to change.
When you update software on your phone you are expecting to working.
Python 3 had some breaking changes.
Something stopped working in 2008.
Different things.
In Python 2 print looked like this
print 'Hello, Geeks' 

Python 3
print('Hope You like these facts')

Differents are not that big.
When we learn python.
You may see some Python 2 code.
Start using Python 3 and stop using Python 2 because of security codes.
Searching for answers.
Reference you can choose.
You may find answers that are still using Python 2

Why So Many Languages?
Tackle the question.
One can we just have one programming language.
In your career you don't have to know 6 languages.
No way in your lifetime to learn all of these languages.
Different programming languages are good at different things.
It is impossible to build different things.
Python is slower than Java,C++.
You don't want to write code for low-level systems and hardware interactions.
Python is good at one thing.
Developer productivity.
Write code really fast.
Build an app on Android.
Build scripts.
Every programming languages excels at something.
Everything has an trade-off.

Exercise: How Does Python Work?
Recommend you really do it.
How does Python works.
Teach somebody how Python works.
Go to the buddies challenge.
It dosen't matter.
