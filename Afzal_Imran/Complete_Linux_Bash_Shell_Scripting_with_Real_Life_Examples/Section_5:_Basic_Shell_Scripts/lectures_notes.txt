 If this happens  = do this
 Otherwise        = do that

#!/bin/bash

count=100
if[ $count -eq 100]
then 
 echo Count is 100
else
 echo Count is not 100
fi

#! /bin/bash

For loop Script

-For loops
  
  Keeps running until specified number of variable
  e.g: variable = 10 then run the script 10 times
  OR

     variable = green, blue, red(then run the script 3 times for each color)

/!/bin/bash

Simple for loop output

for i in 1 2 3 4 5
do
echo "Welcome $i times"
done


#!/bin/bash

for i in eat run jump delay
do
echo See Imran $i
done

We have define done to make the for-loop done 


do-while Scripts
-do while 
  
  The while statement continually executes a block of statements
  while a particular condition is true or not

  e.g: Run a script until 3 pm


  while [ condition ]
  do 

     command1
     command2
     command3

   done


#! /bin/bash
#This script is created by Imran Afzal on 2018

count=1
num=10
while [ $count -lt 10 ]
do  
	echo
	echo $num seconds left to stop this process $1
	echo
	sleep 1
num='expr $num - 1'
count='expr: $count + 1'
done
echo
echo $1 process is stopped!!!
echo


Exit Status
- 0 = OK or Successful
- 1 = Minor problem
- 2 = Serious trouble
- 3-255 = Everything else

echo $?
pwd

Anything above 0 is error code.

#! /bin/bash

ls -l /home/iafzal/check

if[ $? -eq 0]
then
 echo File exist
else
echo File does not exist
fi
