Welcome to Real Life Scripting
-Scripts that relate to real life enviroment


Accessing data from a file
-Create a first script that will pull errors from a file
-Create second script that will format the output of 
 administrative commands

mkdir professional-scripts

ls -ltr

cp /var/log/messages /home/iafzal/professional-scripts

chmod messages iafzal
chown iafzal messages

vi pull-data

#! /bin/bash
# Author: Imran Afzal
# Date: 08/08/2020
# Descrption: This script will pull only Error messages from 
  /var/log/messages

# Modified: 08/08/2020

grep -i error /home/iafzal/professional-scripts/messages

Only getting the error messages.
Trouble shooting in the log-files.

Check Remote Servers Connectivity
Monitor the health check.
You need to ping other remote servers.

-A script to check the status of remote hosts

ping script

#! /bin/bash
# Author: Imran Afzal
# Date: 08/08/2020
# Descrption: This script will ping a remote host and notify

ping -c1 192.168.1.1
        if [ $? -eq 0 ]
        then
        echo OK
        else
        echo NOT OK
        fi


Change the IP to 192.168.1.235


Don't show the output
ping -c1 192.168.1.1 &> /dev/null
        if [ $? -eq 0 ]
        then
        echo OK
        else
        echo NOT OK
        fi

This will return that this is not ok.

If you don't want to output that on the screen.

Define variable
#!/bin/bash

hosts="192.168.1.1"
ping -c1 $hosts &> /dev/null
        if [ $? -eq 0 ]
        then
        echo $hosts OK
        else
        echo $hosts NOT OK
        fi

Sometimes you don't want to see all that junk on the screen.
And ping that in a variable and just specify it just one time.

Multiple IPs
#!/bin/bash

IPLIST="path_to_the_Ip_list_file"


for ip in $(cat $IPLIST)

do
   ping -c1 $ip &> /dev/null
   if [ $? -eq 0 ]
   then
   echo $ip ping passed
   else
   echo $ip ping failed
   fi
done

If you want to ping multiple address.

	then
        echo "Running out of space \"$partition ($usep%)\" on $(hostname) as on $(date)"
        fi
done


--------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------

Or Simply

Write a script to awk only those rows with the value


df -h | awk '0+$5 >= 10 {print}'


To make it presentable

echo
echo Following is the disk space status
echo
df -h | awk '0+$5 >= 10 {print}' | awk '{print $5, $6}'
