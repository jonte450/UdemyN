Important Things To Remember

- Linux has a super adminstrator account "root"

-"root" is the most powerful account that can create, modify
  ,delete accounts and make changes to system configuration files

- Linux is a case-sensitive system

- Avoiding using file names with spaces

Linux File Types

File Symbol		Meaning
-				   Regular file
d 				   Directory
l 				   Link
c 				   Special file or device file
s 				   socket
p  				   Named pipe
b 				   Block device


WILDCARDS

-A wildcard is a character that can be used as a substitute for 
 any of a class of characters in a search

 - * - represents zero or more characters
 - ? - represents a single character
 - [] - represents a range of characters


 Soft Links and Hard Links

- inode = Pointer or number of a file on the hard disk
- Soft Link = Link will be removed if file is removed or renamed
- Hard Link = Deleting renaming or moving the original file will 
  not affect the hard link


FILE OWNERSHIP

- There are 2 owners of a file or directory
  -User and group


Command to change file ownership
 -chown and chgrp
  - chown changes the ownership of a file
  - chgrp changes the group ownership of a file


Recursive ownership change option (Cascade)
 -R


TAB Completetion and Up Arrow
-Hitting TAB key completes the available commands, files or
 directories
 -chm TAB
 -ls j<TAB>
 -cd Des<TAB>


-Hitting up arrow key on the keyboard returns the last command
 ran.


COMBINING AND SPLITTING FILES
- Multiple files can be combined into one and
- One file can be split into multiple files

-cat file1 file2 file3 > file4
-split file4


-e.g. split -1 300 file.txt childfile


Split file.txt into 300 lines per line and output to 
childfileaa, childfileab
and childfilac


Linux File Editor

- A text editor is a program which enables you to create and
  manipulate data (text) in a Linux file

- There are several standard text editors available on most 
  Linux systems

- vi     -  Visual editor
- ed     -  Standard line editor
- ex	 -	Extended line editor
- emacs	 -	A full screen editor
- pico	 -  Beginner's editor
- vim	 -  Advance versions of vi


- Our editor = vi (available in almost every Linux distribution)




vi supplies commands for
 - Inserting and deleting text
 - Replacing text
 - Moving around the file
 - Finding and subtituting strings
 - Cutting and pasting text



Most common keys
- i - insert
- Esc - Escape out of any mode
- r - replace
- d - delete
- :q! - quit without saving
- :wq! - quit and save

"sed" Command

-Replace a string in a file with a newstring
-Find and delete a line
-Remove empty lines
-Remove the first or n lines in a file
-To replace tabs with spaces
-Show defined lines from a file
-Substitute within vi editor
-And much more

sed 's/Kenny/Lenny/g' seinfeld

sed '/Seinfeld/d' seinfeld-characters

System Utility Commands
-date
-uptime
-hostname
-uname
-which
-cal
-bc


Log Monitoring

Another and most important way of system adminstration is log monitor


Log Directory = /var/log
 -boot
 -chronyd = NTP
 -cron
 -maillog
 -secure
 -messages
 -httpd



Terminal Commands
-clear
 Clears your screen

-exit
 Exit out of the shell, terminal or a user session


-script
 The script command stores terminal activities in a log file that can be named by a user, when a name is not provided by a user, the default, the file name, typescript is used






Aliases

50 cents (American rapper) = Curtis James Jackson III

Pitbull (American rapper) = Armando Christian Perez

Alises is a very popular command that is used to cut down on
lengthy and repetitive commands

 -alias ls="ls -al"
 -alias pl="pwd; ls"
 -alias tell="whoami; hostname; pwd"
 -alias dir="ls -l | grep ^d"
 -alias lmar="ls -l | grep Mar"
 -alias wpa= "chmod a+w"
 -alias d ="df -h | awk '{print \$6}' | cut -cl-4"



NIC Bonding
NIC= Network Interface Card (PC or laptop)

NIC(Network Interface Card) bonding is also known 
as Network bonding. It can be defined as the aggregation
or combination of multiple NIC into a single bond interface.

It's main purpose is to provide high availability and redundancy.

NIC Bonding Procedure

- modprobe bonding
- modinfo bonding
- Create /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-bond0
- Edit /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ethernet1
- Edit /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ethernet2

- Restart network = systemctl restart network



File Transfer
-ftp
-scp
-rsync

For Example:

# ftp ftp.server.com
Enter Username:
Enter Password:

At the ftp prompt
ftp>put filename


To exit
ftp>bye

-Enable SELinux
sesstatus 

cd /etc/sysconfig/
more seslinux

man chcon
man checkpolicy


-Change Listening Services Port Numbers




-Keep your OS up to date (security patching)



SELinux (Security Enhanced Linux)

What is SELinux?
 -Security-Enhanced Linux is a Linux Kernel security module 
  that provides a mechanism for supporting access control
  security policies inclucding mandatory access control
  (Wikipedia)

 -It is a project of the United States National Security Agency
  (NSA) and the SELinux community


SELinux options?
 - Enforcing = Enabled 
 (enabled by default in Redhat, CentOS and Fedora)
 - Permissive = Disabled but logs the activity
 - Disable = Disabled and not activity logs

To check SELinux status
- # setstatus OR getenforce


SELinux setting
- # setenforce 0 =  Permissive/Disable
- # setenforce 1 =	Enable


Modify SELinux config for permanent setting
 - /etc/setlinux/config
 - SELinux=enforcing
 - SELinux=disabled

Before modyfying selinux config file
 - Create a snapshot of your VM


 Before reebooting create a file
  - /.autorelabel


 setstatus

 getenforce

 Two main concepts of SELinux
  -Labeling
    -User:role:
    -type:level


  -Type enforcement


To list the labek of a directory
 - ls -lZ /usr/sbin/httpd


To list the label of a directory
 - ls -lZ /etc/httpd


-As the webserver runs its process is labeled in memory as 
 httpd_t:
  - ps axZ | grep httpd



The SELinux assigns the label at the socket level
 - netstat -tnlpz | grep http



 Command to manage SELinux setting:
 -semange -> to Label
  - login
  - user
  - port
  - interface
  - module
  - node
  - file context
  - boolean
    - ON/OFF Switch
    - There are pre-defined out of box Booleans that come with
      SELinux
      - e.g. do we allow ftp server to access home directories
      - can httpd talk to Idap
      - Etc.

    -To get a list of all booleans
      - getsebool -a
      - OR semange boolean -l

    -To enable or turn on a booleans
      - setsebool -P boolean_name on

    -Check error messages related to selinux
      - journalctl

    -To change the type in a label
     - chcon -t httpd_sys_content_t FILENAME
     - semange -t httpd_sys_content_t FILENAME

NFS Install and Configuration
- NFS stands for Network File System, a file system developed
  by Sun Microsystems, Inc.

- It is a client/server system that allows users to access files
  across a network and threat them as if they resided in a local file directory


- For example, if you were using a computer linked to a second 
  computer via NFS, you could access files on the second computer as if they resided in a directory on the first computer. This is acomplished through the processes of exporting (the process by which an NFS server provides remote
  clients with access to its files) and mounting (the process by which client map NFS shared filesystem)


Steps for NFS Server Configuration

-Install NFS packages
 # yum install nfs-utils libnfsidmap 
 (most likely they are installed) 

-Once the packages are installed, enable and start NFS services
 # systemctl enable rpcbind
 # systemctl enable nfs-server
 # systemctl start rpcbind, nfs-server, rpc-statd, nfs-idmapd

-Create NFS share directory and assign permissions
 # mkdir /mypretzels
 # chmod a+rwx /mypretzels

-Modify /etc/exports file to add new shared filesystem
 #	/mypretzels 192.168.12.7 (rw, sync,no_root_squash) 
    = for only 1 host


Steps for NFS Client Configuration

- Install NFS packages
  # yum install nfs-utils rpcbind

- Once the packages are installed enable and start rpcbind service
   # service rpcbind start

- Make sure firewalld or iptables stopped (if running)
   # ps -ef | egrep "firewall|iptable"

- Show mount from the NFS server
  # showmount -e 192.168.1.5 (NFS Server IP)

- Create a mount point
  # mkdir /mnt/app


-Mount the NFS filesystem
 # mount 192.168.1.5:/mypretzels /mnt/kramer

- Verify mounted filesystem
 # df -h

- To unmount
 # unmount /mnt/kramer


 Linux System Performance Issues
 Understanding the problem
  - Processing
  - Disk writing
  - Networking (file transfer etc.)
  - Hardware


 Troubleshooting Steps:

  - Check if the right system is reported or you are on the
    right system

  - Check disk space(df -h du)

  - Check processing
    (top, free, lsmem, /proc/meminfo, vmstat, 
     pmap <PID>, dmidecode, lscpu or /proc/cpuinf)

  - Check disk issues (iostat -y 5, lsof)

  - Check networking (tcpdump -i enps03, 
    lsof -i -P -n | grep -i listen, netstat -plnt or ss -plnt, iftop)

  - Check system uptime(uptime)
  - Check logs
  - Check hardware status by logging into system console
  - Other tools (ptop, iotop ,iptraf, psacct)



Check the diskspace df -h
What are used or free.

Shows all the filesystems: df -a

Check processing: 
top: How many users are logged tasks, memory status.

free: Tell how memory you have on the computer.

lsmem: Tells about the memory blocksize.

proc/meminfo: What's going inside the systems inside right now.

vmstat: Tells about your swap-space.

pmap: Gives information about the process that are running

dmidecode: Gives information about your hardware call the vendor

lscpu: Gives information about the CPU

proc/cpuinfo: Similar to lscpu


iostat: Gives the statitics every 5 seconds

tcpdump: Check the network traffic

lsof: This will give info about what it is open and what is
      listening 

netstat: Gives the same information as lsof but now you use ss

iftop: Telling about the transfer to any other place.

uptime: Check if your system has been reebooted
