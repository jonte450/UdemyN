Command  Prompts and Getting Prompts Back
-What are command prompts?
-A Command prompt, also reffered as a prompt, is a short text at the start of the command line followed by prompt symbol on a command line interface.

First part username @ hostname prompt symbol
Right click open up the termina.
hostname
Stuck at certain points.
Doing cat and click enter you must get the prompt back ctrl-c.


Accessing To Linux System
-Each operating system has a different protocol or client that is used to 
 access the system.

Example/Windows = Remote Desktop(RDP)

VMware ESX =  vSpehere client

Linux = Putty, SecureCRT, 
		SSH from Linux to Linux.


New Network Command (ifconfig and ip)
-CentOS/RHEL 5 or 6 = iconfig
-CentOS/RHEL 7 = ip
-CentOS/RHEL 7.5 and up = ifconfig
 command has been deprecated
-To use ifconfig in 7.5 = "yum install net-tools"

ipconfig or ip a


Important Things to Remeber in Linux
-Linux has a super adminstrator account "root".
-"root" is the most powerful account that can create, modify, delete
  accounts and make changes to system configuration files

-Linux is a case-sensitive system.

-Avoid using file names with spaces.


Introduction to Linux File System
Closet in your shelf.
There is a systematic way you put things in your closet.
CLOSET SYSTEM = OS FILE SYSTEM.
commands = /usr/bin
Attached Devices = /dev
Applications = /etc
			   /var


-OS store data on disk drives using a structure called a filesystem,
 consisting of files, directories, and the information needed to access and locate them

-There are many different types of filesystems. In general, improvements 
 have been made to filesystems with new releases of operating systems, and each new filesystem has been given a different name.
 E.g. ext3, ext4, XFS, NFTS, FAT etc.

-Linux filesystems store information in hieracrchy of directories and 
 files.

Predenied by Windows.
Just like that you can see the file-system.



FileSystem Structure and Description
/boot Contains file that is used by the boot loader(grub.cfg)
/root root user home directory. It is not same as /.
/dev System Devices (e.g, disk, cdrom, speakers, flashdrive, keyboard etc.)

/etc Configuration files.
/bin -> /usr/bin Everyday user commands.
/lsbin -> /usr/sbin.
/opt Optional add-on applications (Not part of OS apps).
/proc Running processes (Only exists in Memory).

/lib -> usr/lib C programming library files needed by commands and apps.
		strace -e open pwd

/tmp Directory for temporary files.
/home Directory for user.
/var System logs.

/run System daemons that start very early (e.g systemd and udev) to store temporary runtime files like PID files.

/mnt To mount external filesystem (e.g. NFS)
/media For cdrom mounts.

FileSystem Navigation Commands(cd, li and pwd)

-When navigating a UNIX filesystem, there are a few important commands.
 -cd
 -pwd
 -ls
 
-"cd" stands for change directory. It is the primary command for moving 
  you around the filesystem.

-"pwd" stands for print working directory. It tells you were the current 
  location is. 

- "ls" stands for list. It lists all the directories/files within a 
  current working directory

In Linux becomes root.

Absolute and Relative Paths
-There are two paths to navigate to a filesystem.
 -Absolute Path
 -Relative Path

-An absolute path always begins with a "/". This indiacates that the
 path starts at the root directory.
 An example of an absolute path is
   cd/var/log/samba

-A relative path does not begin with a "/". It identifies a location to 
 your current position. An example of a relative path is,
 cd/var.
 cd log.
 cd samba.


Directory Listing Attributes
Cover the letter attributes.
When you do ls -l you are going to see different types.
Any files begins with d is a directory.
Any files begins with l is a link.
Any files begins with d is a directory.
Any files begins without anything is regular file.

Number of links.
Owner of the directory.
Month of the directory.


Creating Files and Directories (touch, cp, vi, mkdir)
-Creating Files
 -touch
 -cp
 -vi

-Creating Directories
 -mkdir



Linux File Types

- Regular file
d Directory
l link
c Special file or device file
s socket
p Named pipe
b Block device

Finding Files and Directories(find, locate)

-Two main commands are used to find files/directories
 -find
 -locate

 find . -name "kramer"


Difference Between Find and Locate Commands

-locate uses a prebuilt database, which should be regurarly updated, while find iterates over a filesystem to locate files. Thus, locate is much faster than find, but can be inaccurate if the database
(can be seen as a cache)
is not updated.

-To update locate database run updatedb


Changing Password
-You should change your initial password as soon you login

Command = passwd userid
Old password : - enter your current password
New password : - enter you new password
Retype new password:- re-enter your new password


WildCards(*,?,^,[])
Pick a Card you can match it to any card.

Linux File Names:
e.g. superheroes1, superheroes2...

Wildcards = *,?
superheroes*
?uperheroes*
?*perheroes*

*A wildcard is a character that can be used as a substitute for any class of characters in a search.

- * - represents zero or more characters
- ? - represents a single character
- [] - represents a range of characters

Other \ = (slash)
"as an escape character"

^ = (caret)
"the beginning of the line"

$ = (dollar sign)
"the end of the line"


Hard and Soft Links(In)
-inode = Pointer or number of an file on the hard disk
-Soft Link = Link will be removed if file is removed or renamed
-Hard Link = Deleting renaming or moving the original file will not  
 affect the hard link

-ln
-ln -s

Question 8:
Which command is used to list files?
ls

9

Question 12:

In soft link if source file is deleted then the link is broken but in hard link deleting a source file will not impact the linked file


Module 3 Homework

Change your password

Create 10 files under your home directory (File names = jerry, kramer, george, lex, clark, lois, homer, bart, lisa, and marge)

Create 3 directories under your home directory (Dir name = seinfeld, superman and simpsons)  

Create a new file jupiter and write to it as "Jupiter is a planet".  Then create a soft link in /tmp directory

Also create a hard link of jupiter in /tmp directory

Check the inodes of both links
