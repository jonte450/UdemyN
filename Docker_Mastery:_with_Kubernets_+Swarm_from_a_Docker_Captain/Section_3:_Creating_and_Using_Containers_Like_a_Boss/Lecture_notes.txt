Check Our Docker Install and Config
Containers are the fundamental building block.
How they are different

-Check versions of our docker cli and engine
-Create a Nginx (web server) container
-Learn common container management commands
-Learn Docker networking basics
-Requirements: Have latest Docker installed from last Section

You are in the proper terminal.

First command docker version.
This simply returns the engine.
Our Docker Command line returning the value.
The fact is you get a server means that you can talk with the docker server.

docker info tells about configuration about info image,containers.

And command docker is returning all the commands you can do.
We have this on the top called management commands.
There are so much commands we have the management commands to organize it.

-command: docker versions
  -verified cli can talk to engine
-command: docker info
  -most config values of engine
-docker command line structure
  -old (still works): docker <command> (options)
  -new: docker <command> <sub-command> (options)


The engine is called is daemon.


Starting a Nginx Web Server
-image vs. container
-run/stop/remove containes
-check container logs and processes

Difference between Image vs. Container
-An Image is the application we want to run
-A Container is an instance of that image running as a process
-You can have many containers running off the same image
-In this lecture our image will be the Nginx web server
-Docker's default image "registry" is called Docker Hub (hub.docker.com)

docker container run --publish 80:80 nginx

Docker looked for an image called nginx.
1.Downloaded image 'nginx' from Docker Hub.
2.Started a new container from that image.
3.Opened port 80 on the host IP
4.Routes that traffic to the container IP, port 80

This command below will make the container to run in the background.

sudo docker container run --publish 80:80 --detach nginx

docker container ls

run vs. start
Each time we run we started a new container.
If we don't specify we get's funny names.

docker container run --publish 80:80 --deatch --name webhost nginx.

docker container log webhost
Gives all the logs from the webserver.

docker cointainer --help.
docker container ls -a
docker container -rm three first id of a container.
