Service Types
Exposing Containers

- kubectl expose creates a service for existing pods
- A service is a stable address for pod(s)
- If we want to connect to pod(s), we need a service
- CoreDNS allows us to resolve services by name
- There are different types of services
  -ClusterIP
  -NodePort
  -LoadBalancer
  -ExternalName

Basic Service Types
-ClusterIP (default)
 -Single, internal virtual IP allocated
 -Only reachable from within cluster (nodes and pods)
 -Pods can reach service on apps port number


 -NodePort
  -High port allocated on each node
  -Port is open on every node's OP
  -Anyone can connect (if they can reach node)
  -Other pods need to be updated to this port

 -These services are always available in Kubernetes


-LoadBalancer
 -Controls a LB endpoint external
